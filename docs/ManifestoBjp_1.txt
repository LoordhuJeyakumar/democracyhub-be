Shri Narendra Modi’s 
Letter to the Nation
Mere Priya Parivarjan,
It has been a decade since you blessed Bharatiya Janata Party with the responsibility of serving you. The 
fact  that  you  blessed  me  to  be  your  Pradhan  Sevak  at  an  extremely  important  time  in  the  history  of  our  
country inspires me to work ever harder. In the last ten years, every moment of our time and every ounce of 
our energy has been dedicated for the people’s welfare.
With your trust and support, the nation has seen a massive transformation over the last ten years. While 
development attained an unprecedented speed and scale, a significant transformation has also happened in 
terms of mindset.
Today, our youth are speaking of creating Viksit Bharat by 2047 as a goal that is attainable, as a milestone 
that will certainly be reached. The nation is confident on its journey of becoming self-reliant (Aatmanirbhar). 
This is a big change from the atmosphere of desperation and frustration that the nation had experienced in 
the  decade  prior  to  2014  due  to  the  corruption,  policy  paralysis  and  misrule  by  the  government  of  those  
times.
We have gone from a nation that was in the ‘Fragile Five’ to a nation that is one of the top 5 economies of 
the world. The most important facet of this progress is that the fruits of development reached everyone, 
especially  those  who  needed  it  the  most.  The  mantra  of  Sabka  Saath,  Sabka  Vikas,  Sabka  Vishwas,  Sabka  
Prayas has guided our actions.
The nation’s growth has been powered by the victory of 25 crore people in the battle against poverty. These 
are people who had suffered decades of deprivation of even basic necessities. Today, not only are they 
benefiting from our saturation approach in basic needs like bank accounts, gas connections, toilets, water, 
electricity, etc, but they are also being empowered with new-age facilities like optic fibre connections, digital 
solutions, drones, etc.
The nation’s growth has come from the drastic socio-economic transformation seen in the lives of women, 
farmers, fisherfolks, street vendors, small entrepreneurs, SC, ST and OBC communities. They are being 
directly empowered through the power of technology such as the JAM trinity.
Farmers have been a backbone of our nation’s progress. Whether it is historic MSP hikes, massive rise in 
procurement or making fertilisers available to them inexpensively despite globally high prices, direct income 
support through PM-KISAN, safety net of Fasal Bima, renewed focus on millets, expanded access to local and 
global markets, a number of steps have been taken to empower them. Our Annadatas are also becoming 
Urjadatas due to the PM KUSUM scheme. Empowered by our Beej Se Bazar Tak approach, our farmers have 
done wonders for the country.
The nation’s growth has been fueled by our focus on Vikas and Virasat.
India has been setting new benchmarks in growth of both ecology and economy.
The nation’s growth has been fueled by the achievements of our youth who have not only dared to dream 
big but also worked to realise dreams in various domains such as space, sports and start-ups. In the last ten 
years,  whether  it  is  education,  employment  or  entrepreneurship,  crores  of  new  opportunities  have  been  
created for our youth.
It  is  deeply  emotional  for  each  Bharatiya  Janata  Party  karyakarta,  including  me,  to  be  involved  in  this  
momentous journey as enablers of every Indian’s aspirations.
During an address from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I had said – Yahi Samay Hai, Sahi Samay Hai. Today, 
many respected voices across the globe are also saying that this is India’s time. In fact, today, India is being 
seen as an important player in the global efforts to create a better future.
Making the best use of this historic time period needs us to be proactive. The proactive nature of our 
approach is such that we have already worked on a plan of the decisions to be taken in the first 100 days of 
the new government.
At such a time, when our nation is ready to take off into a new phase of exponential growth, the Amrit Kaal, 
we seek your blessings for the roadmap that we are unveiling for the next five years.
In the next five years, we will take our nation into the top 3 economies of the world, launch a final and 
decisive assault against poverty, open up newer avenues of growth in various sectors, further intensify our 
battle against corruption, unveil the next generation of reforms, and take a number of pro-people decisions 
and actions.
Our Sankalp Patra is more than just a collection of promises. This Sankalp Patra outlines the collective 
aspirations and goals of our nation, by our nation and for our nation. As you have seen in the last ten years, 
it is Modi’s Guarantee that every promise made is fulfilled.
In  2014,  we  received  your  support  to  bring  in  a  monumental  transformation.  In  2019,  we  received  an  even  
bigger mandate and ensured continued development and took big decisions. In the next five years, with 
your blessings, it is Modi’s Guarantee that we will work 24 by 7 for 2047.
Your aspiration is our mission. Your dreams are our responsibility.
Let us create a nation that future generations will be proud of!
Vande Mataram!
Your Pradhan Sevak,
Narendra Modi

My Dear Brothers and Sisters,
The philosophy of “Antyodaya” has been Bharatiya Janata Party’s guiding light since its foundation. This has 
manifested itself in various programmes launched by our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji aimed at Garib 
Kalyan.
In just ten years, our government has achieved path-breaking milestones. With Sabka Saath and Sabka Prayas, 
we are committed towards nation-building and promise to ensure Sabka Vikas by strengthening Sabka 
Vishwas in the BJP government. Modi ki Guarantee 2024 Sankalp Patra is our resolve to continue this progress 
and progress forward in our journey.
As we enter Amrit Kaal of Bharat, a new Vision is now in front of us, a Vision driven by the Panch Pran 
enunciated by our Prime Minister. The General Elections of 2024 will be crucial in defining the course of our 
country.  97 crore voters have made up their minds. Citizens want to go forward. Everyone wants to build the 
country. People have decided to defeat the corrupt alliances.
In just ten years, all of us have worked to bring Bharat from Fragile 5 to place it among the Top 5 economies.  
We are secure and safe today because we have a leader who is decisive and bold.  We are building world class 
infrastructure because we have a leader who believes in long term vision.  We are building an equitable society 
because we have a leader who cares.  Modi ki Guarantee is for all sectors and all 140 crore citizens.
We have embraced our rich heritage and diverse culture. Bhavya Ram Mandir in Ayodhya has rejuvenated our 
society. Our cultural and religious sites are being restored across the country.  Our young citizens are finding a 
new interest in our history and heritage.
Today our voice is being respected on all global platforms because we have a leader who puts Bharat First in all 
international affairs. We are trusted. We are attracting global value chains. We are becoming co-creators of 
technology.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been fulfilling our aspirations since 2014.  And today, ten years later, we 
once again seek your vote and support to build the Viksit Bharat that we all have dreamed for.  We seek your 
full support to bring a massive majority to BJP and Narendra Modiji.
Vande Mataram!

Sankalp Patra
Note
My Dear Brothers and Sisters,
As we stand at the cusp of a transformational era in this country, it is a matter of immense pride and 
gratification for me to present to you the Modi Ki Guarantee 2024 Sankalp Patra. We have realised the 
importance and significance of this document and the immense responsibility that was placed upon us to 
define the Vision of Viksit Bharat. It is our hope that this document captures the essence of the aspirations of 
the 140 crore Bharatiyas.
The Sankalp Patra has been prepared after elaborate and intensive discussions with people across different 
classes, communities and regions. We have made sure that each and every section of the society was heard 
and was able to share with us their aspirations. We express our sincere gratitude to each and every Bharatiya 
who has given us their suggestions to us through our Viksit Bharat campaign. Your suggestions have made this 
document immensely richer.
This Sankalp Patra is the PM Modi’s guarantee that we will work tirelessly to realise your dreams and 
aspirations.  The  nation  has  witnessed  immense  progress  and  development  in  the  last  10  years  in  this  
government under the visionary leadership of PM Shri Narendra Modi. This Sankalp Patra is being presented 
before  the  140  crore  Bharatiya  at  a  time  when  Bharat  is  taking  great  leaps  across  all  the  sectors,  ensuring  
welfare of all its citizens. It is this delivery that inspires unwavering confidence in every Modi ki Guarantee 
among the people of Bharat.
When  the  BJP  government  came  into  power  in  2014,  it  faced  the  daunting  task  of  reviving  the  stalled  
development caused by widespread corruption, ineffective governance, and indecision during the tenure of 
the previous government. Under the previous government, the nation had plunged into despair due to a lack 
of clear intentions, weak leadership, and a dearth of policies aimed at public welfare. Over the past ten years, 
we have managed to steer the country away from the troubles inherited from a decade of mismanagement by 
the previous government, while also accelerating the pace of development.
The second term of the NDA government under the leadership of PM Shri Narendra Modi is proof that the 
hopes of 140 crore Bharatiya have transformed into a solid trust and confidence. 
I would like to appeal to you to join hands with us and support us in the upcoming elections so that our 
collective dream of Viksit Bharat is realised. 
Vande Mataram! 
Rajnath Singh,
Chairperson of the Manifesto Committee
