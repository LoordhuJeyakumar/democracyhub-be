its 138 year journey the Indian National Congress had identified itself with the problems develop ment aspirations and hopes of all the people of India During the freedom struggle its foremost aim was to win freedom It was guided by the wisdom and sacrifice of great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi After independence the Congress article of faith was the Constitution of India of which Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar was the prime architect Since 1947 the Congress has been India s beacon of hope Our policies brought about rapid industrialisation in a predominantly agrarian economy transformed India from a famine struck country to one that exports food grains to countries around the world laid the scientific and technical foundations for India s rise as a global software powerhouse and built world class institutions in research and higher education whose graduates are seen as at par with the world s best Even as liberalisation and reforms caused economic growth to boom under successive Congress governments our social welfare policies ensured that every citizen was able to participate in the India story The social welfare net created by the United Progressive Alliance UPA such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act MGNREGA and the National Food Security Act ensured that India was able to absorb the shocks of the Global Financial Crisis 2008 the Taper Tantrum 2013 demonetisation 2016 and COVID 19 2020 We reiterate that the Constitution of India shall remain our sole guide and companion in our never ending journey 3 Five years ago on the eve of the Lok Sabha polls the Congress had published a 54 page manifesto Based on the record of the first term of the Modi government we had forewarned the people of the precarious state of our polity and economy and of the danger of re electing the BJP NDA government Our assessment of the situation in the country has alas proved true Many of the weaknesses and woes have deepened in the last five years The promises and assurances that the Congress gave in its 2019 manifesto remain valid and doubly relevant today Hence we will start with endorsing our 2019 manifesto and urge you to read the statements here as part of this manifesto Our greatest concern was the prevailing climate of fear intimidation and hatred In the last five years every section of the people has lived in fear laws and investigating agencies have been weaponised to intimidate people and through its words and actions the BJP and its affiliates have spread hatred among people belonging to different religious language and caste groups Today the dangers that we had warned against have become a hard reality The economy is in a crisis Despite the claim that India is the fastest growing large economy in the world our growth rate has fallen from an average of 6 7 per cent new series during the UPA period of 2004 14 to an average of 5 9 per cent during 2014 24 As against the goal of doubling the economy which the UPA did achieve India s GDP in real terms will rise from 100 lakh crore in 2013 14 to only 173 lakh crore in 2023 24 far short of the target We may recall our forewarning We had said Youth have lost jobs The unemployment rate is 8 percent among graduates the unemployment rate is over 40 We had said Farmers have lost hope Farmers had to come on to the streets for 16 months to fight the three farm laws that would have made them tenant farmers of corporate houses and the farmers are back on the streets again We had said Traders have lost business The Goods and Services Tax GST laws have squeezed exorbitant tax revenues out of lakhs of traders and constrained free trade We had said Micro small and medium enterprises have lost their confidence Lakhs of MSMEs have shut down and are no longer creators of jobs We had said Women have lost a sense of security Crimes against women have increased by 31 per cent between 2014 and 2022 We had said Deprived communities have lost their economic rights Scheduled Castes SC Scheduled Tribes ST and Other Backward Classes OBC communities have been deprived of jobs because of the unfilled vacancies in government and other public institutions Tribal people have been denied their rights under the Forest Rights Act We had said Institutions have lost independence Every institution including Constitutional bodies has been undermined and in some cases forced to become subservient to the government 4 The decline in the growth rate has serious consequences for the people especially for those who belong to the poor and middle classes The impact has fallen on per capita income consumption of goods and services and standard of living Household net assets have declined household liabilities have increased and families have borrowed more Inequality between the rich on the one hand and the poor and middle classes on the other have increased sharply dealing a body blow to the goals of equality equity and social and economic justice A report titled Income and Wealth Inequality in India 1922 2023 The Rise of the Billionaire Raj by leading global economists including Thomas Piketty shows that India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi is more unequal than even under the British Raj The share of national income earned by India s top 1 per cent is today at its highest historical levels and is among the highest globally The rise of inequality has been particularly pronounced between 2014 and 2023 The numbers of registered and active workers under MGNREGA and the fact that 80 crore people depend on free grain 5 kg per person per month are definite indicators of widespread poverty On the Global Hunger Index India s rank is 111 out of 125 countries The gravest danger is that India may no longer be a truly free and democratic republic Democracy in India has been hollowed out and we are rapidly sliding to become a one party and one person dictatorship The federal structure is under attack with the central government appropriating most of the central revenues passing laws on subjects that were hitherto left to the state governments and using its financial and executive powers to reduce states to municipalities Governors of non BJP governed states are encouraged to paralyse the working of elected governments Laws and investigating agencies are used to foist false cases against non BJP leaders to force them to submit to the BJP s will The media has been rewarded or intimidated to become a vehicle of propaganda of the government Ask yourself two questions 1 Is your life better today than what it was in 2014 2 Is your mind without fear as dreamed by Rabindranath Tagore The choice is not Congress or BJP but it is more than that The choice is Democratic government or Authoritarian rule Freedom or Fear Prosperity for All or Wealth for a Few Justice or Injustice The 2024 general election presents an opportunity for radically changing the style and substance of gover nance that has been in evidence in the past decade of Anyay Kaal We appeal to you to look beyond religion language and caste choose wisely and install a democratic government that will work for all the people of India We appeal to you to vote for the INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS 5 EQUITY Social Justice Congress has been the most vocal and active champion of the progress of the backward and oppressed classes and castes over the last seven decades However caste discrimination is still a reality The people belonging to the SC ST and OBC communities have not yet been able to catch up with the rest and are still left behind While OBC SC and ST constitute nearly 70 per cent of India s population their representation in high ranking professions services and businesses is disproportionately low No progressive modern society should

the people have come to look upon the judiciary as the last bastion against anti democratic actions and authoritarianism An independent judiciary alone can uphold the Constitution of India 1 The

examples are demonetisation the Rafale deal Pegasus spyware and the Electoral Bonds scheme Congress will probe these dubious deals and schemes and bring to law those who made illegal gains through these measures Known offenders were allowed to leave the country in the last 10 years The BJP NDA government is perceived to have facilitated their leaving the country and has not been able to bring back any of the scamsters The circumstances under which they were allowed to leave the country will be probed and all scamsters and their accomplices will be brought before the law The BJP has turned

as political and social justice Sound economic policies will ensure that India a developing country will attain the status of first a middle income country and then a developed country Congress economic policy has evolved over the years In 1991 the Congress ushered in the era of liberalization and steered the country toward an open free and competitive economy with regulatory oversight The country reaped enormous benefits in terms of wealth creation new businesses and entrepreneurs a huge middle class millions of jobs important innovations in education and healthcare and exports Millions of people were lifted out of poverty We reiterate our commitment to an open economy in which economic growth will be driven by the private sector comple mented by a strong and viable public sector TIME FOR A RE SET After 33 years the time is ripe for a re set of economic policy We need a Nav Sankalp Economic Policy The cornerstone of the Nav Sankalp Economic Policy will be JOBS To create jobs India must become a producing economy We must produce goods and services for ourselves and for the world There is a huge opportunity for India to emerge as the world s biggest producer We reject jobless growth and the BJP s legacy of job loss growth We will address the issues of inflation extreme poverty among a significant section of the people hunger nutritional deficiency among women and children and the growing inequalities of income and wealth The three goals of our economic policy were and will be work wealth and welfare WORK Work means there will be plenty of jobs and sufficient opportunities for self employment and starting businesses 1 We will create thousands of jobs as outlined in the next chapter The best creator of jobs is the private sector In particular the MSME sector is the creator of the largest number of jobs especially for workers with average education and average skills 2 We will support the private sector and every kind of enterprise large medium small and micro in their endeavour to create jobs and produce goods and services 3 We will remove the current environment of distrust and fear and create a healthy eco system where private enterprises

field for all 9 We are opposed to monopolies and oligopolies and crony capitalism 10 We will ensure that no company or person arrogates to itself or himself the financial or material resources or the business opportunities or the concessions that ought to be available to every entrepreneur 11 Our policy preference will be in favour of business enterprises that create a large number of jobs 12 Full employment is our goal and we will make every effort to ensure that the large workforce is gainfully employed 13 We will introduce reforms in industrial and labour laws to restore the balance between

productivity is equally important Any impediment legal or administrative to larger production or higher value will be removed We will facilitate access to finances raw materials technology intellectual property and other resources both from within India and through imports Business enterprises will have the liberty to sell goods and services within India or through exports All laws and rules that inhibit free and fair trade will be reviewed and changed India s GDP in 1990 91 was approximately 25 lakh crore in constant prices In 13 years first under a Congress govern ment and later under coalition governments the GDP doubled and reached a value of 50 lakh crore in 2003 04 In 10 years under the UPA the economy doubled again and the GDP was at 100 lakh crore in 2013 14 A 100 lakh crore economy was inherited by the BJP NDA government but it wasted the golden opportunity If the UPA had continued in office the economy would have doubled again and stood at 200 lakh crore in 2023 24 Alas due to the BJP s mismanagement the GDP will reach a level of only 173 lakh crore by the end of 2023 24 falling short of a target that was unachievable The Congress is committed to rapid growth and generation of wealth We have set a target of doubling the GDP in the next 10 years WELFARE Welfare of all is the goal of all work and the creation of wealth Owing to the skewed policies of the BJP NDA the people of India are divided in economic terms There is a small class of very rich a substantial middle class a large segment of people above the poverty line but not yet the middle class and nearly 22 crore people who are poor Under a Congress government the welfare of the poor will be the first charge on all government resources It will be the Congress endeavour to ensure that the 22 crore people below the poverty line are lifted above the line in the next 10 years that they are able to enjoy the fruits of education healthcare housing drinking water sanitation electricity and above all opportunities for jobs work and are made strong and self reliant to compete with others who are higher on the economic ladder As people move up the economic ladder their needs are for better infrastructure and better goods and services Besides we must get the Indian economy and the Indian work force future ready The challenges of the future include the changes in the global economy advanced technology such as Artificial Intelligence robotics and machine learning and climate change The future of our energy is Green Energy We will mobilize the massive capital required for our green energy transition The Nav Sankalp Economic Policy will aim to build a fair just and equal opportunity economy and bring prosperity to all sections of the people Congress will herald a new beginning just as we did in 1991 involving all sections of the people in nation building The time has become to re set and re prioritize our roadmap for economic development in the context of the twin challenges to our economy namely UNEMPLOYMENT and INFLATION We have made specific promises in different sections of this Manifesto By implementing these promises we hope to achieve the paramount goal of ushering in a fair just and equitable economy that will make India a rich country and that will be resilient to adapt to a changing world 29 The most challenging issue today is widespread unemployment The cry everywhere is for jobs The unemployment rate ranges from 10 per cent for age 15 29 to 42 3 per cent for graduates under age 25 to 9 8 per cent for graduates of age 30 34 No one has any faith in the BJP which deceived the people with the false claim that it will create 2 crore jobs a year The BJP NDA government s response to the grave problem was to abandon labour force surveys distort data and pretend that the problem does not exist We acknowledge the problem and we promise to create millions of jobs through concrete initia tives UNEMPLOYMENT MEETING THE CRY FOR JOBS 1 Fill the nearly 30 lakh vacancies in sanctioned posts at various levels in the central government teaching and non teaching posts in central educational institutions posts of doctors nurses paramedics and other support ing staff in central government medical institutions and vacancies in the Central Armed Police Forces CAPF 2 Publish a job calendar for each department institu tion and

a few exceptions that will not burden the poor 7 GST will not be levied on agricultural inputs 8 The GST Council will be re designed It will be the final authority on policy and on all matters relating to GST 9 The administration of GST laws will be divided horizontally between the central government and the state governments Small GST payers below a thresh old will come under the purview

will be given significant tax relief 12 The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal ITAT the Goods and Services Tax Appellate Tribunal GSTAT and the Customs Appellate Tribunal CESTAT will be autonomous judicial bodies without interference by the government TAXATION AND TAX REFORMS Taxation forms the core of governance The last ten years of the BJP NDA government is a case of taxation gone berserk The share of taxes paid by the common person and the poor through regressive indirect taxes has increased significantly and the share of taxes paid by corporates has decreased the exact opposite of what a people friendly and progressive taxation policy should be Despite the tall claims of increasing the tax base through demonetistion and GST India s overall tax to GDP has not increased in the last decade leaving very little room for increased expendi ture Congress will undertake a complete overhaul of India s taxation system to make it people friendly and efficient and to incentivise private savings and investment 31 INDUSTRY In order to become a developed economy and create good quality jobs for hundreds of thousands of youth it is critical that India transitions from a consumer economy to a producer economy India must become a manufacturing powerhouse that produces goods and services for itself and the world To this end beyond economic and business factors the most vital ingredient is social harmony that will attract investments and a skilled labour force It is thus no surprise that in the last 25 years India s manufacturing share of GDP has been higher during the Congress rule On the contrary in the last 10 years 2014 24 the share of manufac turing has stagnated at 14 per cent 1 Congress resolves to make India a manufacturing hub by raising the share of manufacturing from 14 per cent to 20 per cent of GDP in the next five years 2 The most immediate objective will be to restore a healthy fearless and a trustworthy climate for business es While a Congress government in 1991 abolished industrial licensing and controls the independent regulatory regime that was put in place has deteriorated into a system of overt and covert controls We will conduct a comprehensive review of the current rules and regulations and repeal or amend them in order to restore freedom to industry business and trade 3 Congress will aim for India attaining a position of leadership in multiple industries such as steel metals garments and textiles cement automobiles electronic goods pharmaceuticals engineering goods petroleum products chemicals and mining rare earths and critical

capital increase the pace of construction and augment infra structure The focus will be on design quality speed of implementation maintenance and accountability 2 Private capital must be attracted to create public assets and infrastructure The BJP NDA government has inverted this model and is using public money to create assets that eventually find their way into private hands Congress will stop this loot of public money 3 We will modernise the outdated railway infrastructure but in doing so we will ensure that trains and stations serve the needs of the common people and commuters The railway

undertaking such projects INFRASTRUCTURE The hardware of an economy are roads railways ports airports and electricity Capital expenditure and modern technology have to be mobilized to create infrastructure of world class quality A variety of models of building infrastructure must be adopted according to the needs of the economy 33 34 FEDERALISM Centre State Relations Federalism is the foundational principle of India is a Union of States India s fabric of federalism stitched together by mutual trust between the Union and States has been systematically destroyed by the BJP NDA

efforts in determining the shares of states in the devolution of central tax revenues We will work with state governments to evolve a formula to devolve funds including a share of GST revenues

Chairperson for effective governance in urban local bodies The administration will be accountable to the Mayor Chair person and the Council 6 Congress as the author of the 73rd and 74th Consti tution

clear stream of reason has not lost its way Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit Where the mind is led forward by thee Into ever widening thought and action Into that heaven of freedom my Father let my country awake AN APPEAL 45 46 1 Qty 3000 s","labels":["economy","rural
