During the freedom struggle, its foremost aim was to win \nfreedom. It was guided by the wisdom and sacrifice of great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi. After independence, the \nCongress’ article of faith was the Constitution of India of which Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar was the prime architect.\nSince 1947, the Congress has been India’s beacon of hope. Our policies brought about rapid industrialisation in a \npredominantly agrarian economy, transformed India from a famine-struck country to one that exports food grains to \ncountries around the world, laid the scientific and technical foundations for India’s rise as a global software \npowerhouse, and built world class institutions in research and higher education whose graduates are seen as at par \nwith the world’s best. Even as liberalisation and reforms caused economic growth to boom under successive \nCongress governments, our social welfare policies ensured that every citizen was able to participate in the India \nstory. The social welfare net created by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) such as the Mahatma Gandhi National \nRural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and the National Food Security Act ensured that India was able to \nabsorb the shocks of the Global Financial Crisis (2008), the Taper Tantrum (2013), demonetisation (2016) and \nCOVID-19 (2020).\nWe reiterate that the \nConstitution of India \nshall remain our sole \nguide and companion \nin our never-ending \njourney.\n3\n\nFive years ago, on the eve of the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had published a 54-page manifesto. Based on the \nrecord of the first term of the Modi government, we had forewarned the people of the precarious state of our polity \nand economy, and of the danger of re-electing the BJP/NDA government. Our assessment of the situation in the \ncountry has, alas, proved true. Many of the weaknesses and woes have deepened in the last five years. The promises \nand assurances that the Congress gave in its 2019 manifesto remain valid and doubly relevant today. Hence, we will \nstart with endorsing our 2019 manifesto and urge you to read the statements here as part of this manifesto.\nOur greatest concern was the prevailing ‘climate of fear, intimidation and hatred’. In the last five years, every section \nof the people has lived in fear; laws and investigating agencies have been weaponised to intimidate people; and \nthrough its words and actions the BJP and its affiliates have spread hatred among people belonging to different \nreligious, language and caste groups.\nToday, the dangers that we had warned against have become a hard reality.\nThe economy is in a crisis. Despite the claim that India is the fastest growing large economy in the world, our growth \nrate has fallen from an average of 6.7 per cent (new series) during the UPA period of 2004-14 to an average of 5.9 per \ncent during 2014-24. As against the goal of doubling the economy (which the UPA did achieve), India’s GDP in real \nterms will rise from \u0006100 lakh crore in 2013-14 to only \u0006173 lakh crore in 2023-24, far short of the target.\nWe may recall our forewarning\n• We had said, “Youth have lost jobs”. The unemployment rate is 8 \npercent; among graduates the unemployment rate is over 40%.\n• We had said, “Farmers have lost hope”. Farmers had to come on to \nthe streets for 16 months to fight the three farm laws that would have \nmade them tenant-farmers of corporate houses; and the farmers are \nback on the streets again.\n• We had said, “Traders have lost business”. The Goods and Services \nTax (GST) laws have squeezed exorbitant tax revenues out of lakhs of \ntraders and constrained free trade.\n• We had said, “Micro, small and medium enterprises have lost their \nconfidence”. Lakhs of MSMEs have shut down and are no longer \ncreators of jobs\n• We had said, “Women have lost a sense of security”. Crimes against \nwomen have increased by 31 per cent between 2014 and 2022.\n• We had said “Deprived communities have lost their economic \nrights”. Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other \nBackward Classes (OBC) communities have been deprived of jobs \nbecause of the unfilled vacancies in government and other public \ninstitutions. Tribal people have been denied their rights under the \nForest Rights Act.\n• We had said, “Institutions have lost independence”. Every institution, \nincluding Constitutional bodies, has been undermined and, in some \ncases, forced to become subservient to the government.\n4\n\nThe decline in the growth rate has serious consequences for the people, especially for those who belong to the \npoor and middle classes. The impact has fallen on per capita income, consumption of goods and services, and \nstandard of living. Household net assets have declined, household liabilities have increased and families have \nborrowed more.\nInequality between the rich on the one hand and the poor and middle classes on the other have increased \nsharply dealing a body blow to the goals of equality, equity, and social and economic justice. A report titled \n“Income and Wealth Inequality in India, 1922-2023: The Rise of the Billionaire Raj” by leading global economists, \nincluding Thomas Piketty, shows that India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi is more unequal than even \nunder the British Raj. The share of national income earned by India’s top 1 per cent is today at its highest \nhistorical levels and is among the highest globally. The rise of inequality has been particularly pronounced \nbetween 2014 and 2023.\nThe numbers of registered and active workers under MGNREGA and the fact that 80 crore people depend on \nfree grain (5 kg per person per month) are definite indicators of widespread poverty. On the Global Hunger \nIndex, India’s rank is 111 out of 125 countries.\nThe gravest danger is that India may no longer be a truly free and democratic republic. Democracy in India has \nbeen hollowed out and we are rapidly sliding to become a one-party and one-person dictatorship. The federal \nstructure is under attack with the central government appropriating most of the central revenues, passing laws \non subjects that were hitherto left to the state governments, and using its financial and executive powers to \nreduce states to municipalities. Governors of non-BJP-governed states are encouraged to paralyse the working \nof elected governments. Laws and investigating agencies are used to foist false cases against non-BJP leaders \nto force them to submit to the BJP’s will. The media has been rewarded or intimidated to become a vehicle of \npropaganda of the government.\nAsk yourself two questions:\n(1) Is your life better today than what it was in 2014?\n(2) Is your mind without fear as dreamed by Rabindranath Tagore?\nThe choice is not Congress or BJP, but it is more than that. The choice is \nDemocratic government or Authoritarian rule\n      Freedom or Fear\n            Prosperity for All or Wealth for a Few\n                   Justice or Injustice.\nThe 2024 general election presents an opportunity for radically changing the style and substance of gover-\nnance that has been in evidence in the past decade of Anyay Kaal. We appeal to you to look beyond religion, \nlanguage and caste, choose wisely, and install a democratic government that will work for all the people of \nIndia. We appeal to you to vote for the INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS.\n5\n\nEQUITY\nSocial Justice\nCongress has been the most vocal and active champion of the progress of the backward and oppressed classes and \ncastes over the last seven decades. However, caste discrimination is still a reality. The people belonging to the SC, ST \nand OBC communities have not yet been able to catch up with the rest and are still left behind. While OBC, SC and ST \nconstitute nearly 70 per cent of India’s population, their representation in high-ranking professions, services and \nbusinesses is disproportionately low. No progressive modern society should tolerate such inequality or discrimina-\ntion based on ancestry and the consequent denial of equal opportunity. Congress will bridge historical inequities by \nimplementing the following programme.\n6. We will enhance institutional credit to SC and ST for \nhome-building, starting businesses and purchasing \nassets.\n7. Congress will establish an authority to monitor the \ndistribution to the poor of government land and surplus \nland under the land ceiling Acts.\n8. The scope of the Public Procurement Policy will be \nexpanded to award more public works contracts to \ncontractors belonging to the SC and ST communities.\n9. Funds for scholarships for OBC, SC and ST students \nwill be doubled, especially for higher education. We will \naid SC and ST students to study abroad; and will \ndouble the number of scholarships for them to pursue \na Ph.D.\n10. Congress will establish a network of residential \nschools for the poor, especially SC and ST students, \nand extend them to every block.\n1.Congress will conduct a nation-wide Socio-Economic \nand Caste Census to enumerate the castes and \nsub-castes and their socio-economic conditions. \nBased on the data, we will strengthen the agenda for \naffirmative action.\n2. The Congress guarantees that it will pass a \nconstitutional amendment to raise the 50 per cent cap \non reservations for SC, ST and OBC.\n3. The reservation of 10 per cent in jobs and educational \ninstitutions for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) \nwill be implemented for all castes and communities \nwithout discrimination.\n4. We will fill all the backlog vacancies in posts reserved \nfor SC, ST and OBC within a period of one year.\n5. Congress will abolish the contractualisation of \nregular jobs in the government and public sector \nenterprises and ensure regularisation of such \nappointments.\n6\n\n11. We will include in the curriculum of schools the life \nand work of social reformers to spread the message of \nsocial justice.\n12. We will establish Ambedkar Bhavans-cum-Libraries \nin every district to promote the habit of reading and \ndiscussion.\n13. We will enact a law with reference to Article 15(5) of \nthe Constitution to provide for reservation in private \neducational institutions for SC, ST and OBC.\n14. We will pass a law authorising allocation of resourc-\nes for the Scheduled Caste Sub Plan and Tribal Sub Plan \nwithin the annual budget and monitoring the execution \nof the plans.\n15. Congress will end the evil of manual scavenging. \nEvery manual scavenger will be rehabilitated, re-skilled, \nprovided a job and assured a life of dignity and safety. \nThe Prohibition of Manual Scavenging Act, 2013, will be \nstrictly implemented and any person employing anyone \nfor manual scavenging shall be punished. We will \nprovide compensation of \u000630 lakh to families of sanita-\ntion workers (safai karamcharis) deceased while at \nwork. We will allocate sufficient funds to enable the \nprocurement of machines that will clean sewers and \nseptic tanks, and remove human waste. Free insurance \nwill be provided to all sanitation workers.\n16. The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes \n(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 will be enforced \ndiligently. A helpline will be established in every State’s \ncapital and legal aid and paralegal support will be \nprovided to the victims of such atrocities.\n17. Congress is committed to notify as ‘Scheduled \nArea’ all habitations or groups of habitations where ST \nare the largest social group outside the present Sched-\nuled Areas in all States and Union Territories.\n18. A national mission will be set up for effective \nimplementation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006 through \na dedicated FRA division, a separate budget and action \nplans.\n19. The Congress will ensure settlement of all pending \nFRA claims within 1 year and establish a process for \nreview of all rejected claims within 6 months.\n20. Congress is committed to ensure that states enact \nlaws in conformity with the framework of the central \nPanchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 \n(PESA) to establish 'Village Council’ and 'Autonomous \nDistrict Council’ as envisaged in PESA.\n21. We will enact the Rohith Vemula Act to address \ndiscrimination faced by students belonging to the \nbackward and oppressed communities in educational \ninstitutions.\n22. We will implement the recommendations of the \nRenke Commission. We will provide free education for \nchildren belonging to the Nomadic Tribes and De-noti-\nfied Tribes.\n23. Congress will establish a Diversity Commission \nthat will measure, monitor and promote diversity in \npublic and private employment and education.\nRELIGIOUS AND\nLINGUISTIC\nMINORITIES\nThe plurality of religions represents the history of \nIndia. History cannot be altered. All people living in \nIndia and all children born in India are equally \nentitled to enjoy human rights that includes the \nright to practise one’s religion. Pluralism and \ndiversity constitute the ethos of India and are \nenshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution of \nIndia. Given the history and the democratic \ntraditions of India, the Congress believes that \nthere is no place for authoritarianism or majoritari-\nanism.\nLinguistic and religious minorities are granted \nhuman and civic rights under the Constitution of \nIndia. Congress pledges to uphold and protect \nthese rights.\n7\n\n1.We will respect and uphold the fundamental right to \npractice one’s faith and the rights guaranteed to \nreligious minorities under Articles 15, 16, 25, 26, 28, 29 \nand 30 of the Constitution.\n2. We will also respect and uphold the rights of linguis-\ntic minorities guaranteed under Articles 15, 16, 29 and \n30 of the Constitution.\n3. We will encourage and assist students and youth \nbelonging to the minorities to take full advantage of the \ngrowing opportunities in education, employment, \nbusiness, services, sports, arts and other fields.\n4. We will restore the Maulana Azad Scholarships for \nstudy abroad and increase the number of scholarships.\n5. The economic empowerment of minorities is a \nnecessary step for India to realise its full potential. We \nwill ensure that banks will provide institutional credit to \nminorities without discrimination.\n6. We will ensure that the minorities receive their fair \nshare of opportunities in education, healthcare, public \nemployment, public works contracts, skill development, \nsports and cultural activities without discrimination.\n7. Congress will ensure that, like every citizen, minori-\nties have the freedom of choice of dress, food, \nlanguage and personal laws.\n8. We will encourage reform of personal laws. Such \nreform must be undertaken with the participation and \nconsent of the communities concerned.\n9. Congress promises to meet long standing demands \nfor inclusion of more languages in the Eighth Schedule \nof the Constitution.\nSENIOR CITIZENS, PERSONS\nWITH DISABILITIES, AND LGBTQIA+\n8\n\n1. We promise that healthcare will be universal and free \nin public health centres such as hospitals, clinics, \nprimary health centres, mobile healthcare units, dispen-\nsaries and health camps. Free healthcare will include \nexamination, diagnostics, treatment, surgery, medicines, \nrehabilitation and palliative care.\n2. The Rajasthan Model of cashless insurance up to\n\u000625 lakhs will be adopted for universal healthcare.\n3. Primary Health Centres (PHC) will be upgraded \naccording to Indian Public Health Standards norms, \nand diagnostics will be added in each PHC.\nHEALTH\nCongress was the first political \nparty to acknowledge that health \nof the people and healthcare are \nthe responsibility of the govern-\nment. Congress introduced the \nfirst healthcare scheme in India \nand firmly believes that all \ncitizens have the Right to Health.\n1. The central government’s contribution to pensions for \nsenior citizens, widows and persons with disabilities \nunder the National Social Assistance Programme \nremains a pitiful \u0006200 - \u0006500 per month. Congress will \nraise this amount to \u00061,000 per month.\n2. We will take measures to ensure easy access to legal \nservices for senior citizens especially in cases of \nneglect, abuse, abandonment, eviction and financial \nfraud.\n3. Congress will review the Maintenance and Welfare of \nParents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, remove the \ndeficiencies and enforce the Act.\n4. We will restore travel concessions in public transport \n(rail and road) for senior citizens.\n5. We will expand Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution \nto prohibit discrimination on the ground of ‘disability’, \n‘impairment’ or ‘sexual orientation’.\n6. We will recognise the Braille script and Sign \nLanguage as languages.\n7. We will establish a National Centre of Research and \nExcellence for Special Education to ensure that quality \neducation is imparted to children with special needs \nand children with disabilities.\n8. As was done in Chhattisgarh, Congress will provide \nrepresentation for persons with disabilities in local \ngovernment bodies.\n9. We will strictly enforce the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities Act, 2016.\n10. We will implement a scheme to establish Assisted \nLiving and Care Centres for the disabled in public-pri-\nvate partnership throughout the country.\n11. After wide consultation, Congress will bring a law \nto recognize civil unions between couples belonging to \nthe LGBTQIA+ community.\n9\n\n4. We will encourage the introduction of health \ninsurance schemes in the private sector and public \nsector. The current universal healthcare programme will \nbe redesigned for different sections of the people and \nwill allow enlistment of private hospitals, non-profit \nhealth facilities and health centres under the schemes.\n5. Maternity benefits will be available to all women. All \nemployers shall mandatorily grant paid maternity leave \nfor their employees.\n6. Budget allocation for Health will be increased step by \nstep every year to achieve 4 per cent of total\nexpenditure by 2028-29.\n7. Congress will double the hardship allowance of \ndoctors serving in rural areas, and provide suitable \nresidence facilities.\n8. The contribution of the Central government to the pay \nof frontline health workers (such as ASHA,\nAnganwadi, Mid-Day Meal cooks, etc.) will be doubled.\n9. We will establish one government medical \ncollege-cum-hospital in each district.\n10. All vacancies in medical and paramedical posts in \npublic health institutions and all vacancies in medical \ncolleges will be filled in three years.\n11. No hospital or medical college shall be permitted to \nbe opened or allowed to function unless 75 per cent of \nthe medical, paramedical and teaching posts are filled.\n12. The National Medical Commission Act shall be \nreviewed, and the anomalies and deficiencies removed. \nNMC shall enjoy full autonomy to carry out the obliga-\ntions under the Act.\n13. A second ASHA will be appointed in villages with a \npopulation of over 2,500.\n14. All systems of medicine will be supported by the \ngovernment.\n15. All manufacturers of medicines will be under strict \nscrutiny for maintaining quality and following good \nmanufacturing practices.\n16. The number of central government dispensaries \nwill be rapidly expanded. All central government \ndispensaries will dispense brand and generic medi-\ncines of good quality at reasonable prices.\n17. A National Mission on Immunisation will be taken \nup. Only 76 per cent of Indian children receive full \nimmunisation. Congress will ensure full immunisation \nof 100 per cent of children within 5 years.\n18. Nutritional deficiency among children will be \naddressed to rapidly reduce the incidents of stunting \nand wasting. We will expand the mid-day meal scheme \nup to Class XII.\n19. Congress will pass a law making it an offence to \ncommit acts of violence against doctors and other \nhealth professionals while performing their duties.\n10\n\nYOUTH\n1. Congress guarantees a new Right to Apprenticeship \nAct to provide a one year apprenticeship with a private \nor a public sector company to every diploma holder or \ncollege graduate below the age of 25. Apprentices will \nget \u00061 lakh a year. The apprenticeship will impart skills, \nenhance employability and provide full-time job opportu-\nnities for millions of youth.\n2. We will provide fast-track courts to adjudicate cases \nof leaking question papers for job examinations and \nprovide monetary compensation to the victims.\n3. We will fill the nearly 30 lakh vacancies in sanctioned \nposts at various levels in the central government. We \nwill stipulate that vacancies in the \npanchayats and municipal bodies shall be filled accord-\ning to a timetable agreed with state governments.\n4. Congress will restructure the Fund of Funds Scheme \nfor start-ups and allocate 50 per cent of the available \nfund, as far as possible equally among all districts, for \nproviding funds to youth below 40 years of age to start \ntheir own businesses and generate employment.\n5. Government will give a one-time relief to applicants \nwho were unable to write the qualifying public exam-\ninations during 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2021 due to the \npandemic.\n6. We will abolish application fees for government \nexaminations and government posts.\n7. Due to widespread unemployment, as a one-time \nmeasure of relief, the amount due including unpaid \ninterest as on 15 March 2024 in respect of all student \neducational loans will be written off and the banks will \nbe compensated by the government.\n8. Congress will provide sports scholarships of \n\u000610,000 per month for talented and budding sportsper-\nsons below the age of 21.\nJobs\n“The future lies in the youth of today” is particularly relevant for a young nation like India with a median age of just \n28 years. The youth of India face joblessness as well as hopelessness. The root cause is massive unemployment \nthat has got worse every year under the BJP/NDA government. Congress will tackle this issue on a war footing with \na clear Yuva Nyay programme.\n11\n\n1. Congress brought in the Right to Education (RTE) Act \nin 2009 that transformed education for children \nbetween the ages of 6 and 14. We will amend the RTE \nAct to make education from Class I to Class XII in public \nschools compulsory and free.\n2. The New Education Policy (NEP) announced by the \nBJP/NDA government has been opposed by education-\nists and several state governments. Education is a \nconcurrent subject and the rights of states to formulate \nan education policy must be respected. Hence, we will \nrevisit and amend the NEP in consultation with the state \ngovernments.\n3. We will end the practice of charging special fees for \ndifferent purposes in public schools.\n4. For greater equity, affordability and transparency in \nschool fees charged by private schools, we will encour-\nage state governments to establish fee regulation \ncommittees.\n5. The quality of teaching is the most important deter-\nminant of educational outcomes. Congress will work \nwith states to ensure that every class and every subject \nhas a dedicated teacher. Each class must have a \ndedicated classroom.\n6. Foundational learning emphasising literacy, numera-\ncy, foundational science and Constitutional values in \nschools is an important requirement for all children. \nCongress will expand the budget for and scale up \ngovernment programmes for foundational learning.\n7. School and college syllabuses will emphasise the \nstudy of STEM subjects in order to develop a scientific \ntemper.\n8. We will discourage the use of teachers for \nnon-teaching activities.\n9. We will discourage the appointment of contractual \nteachers in regular vacancies and ensure that such \nappointments are regularised.\n10. We will accelerate the integration of pre-primary \nand primary education to ensure that all children \nreceive at least two years of pre-school education.\n11. Annual surveys have revealed the huge gaps in \nlearning outcomes in school education. We shall take \nurgent measures to address these deficiencies and \nensure wholesome learning outcomes within a period \nof 5 years.\n12. Congress will increase the number of Kendriya \nVidyalayas, Navodya Vidyalayas and Kasturba Gandhi \nBalika Vidyalayas in consultation with the State \nGovernments.\n13. We will restore the autonomy of colleges and \nuniversities. Higher educational institutions will have \nacademic freedom and will be encouraged to experi-\nment, innovate and promote research. We will protect \nand preserve students’ freedom of speech and expres-\nsion and the right to have elected student unions.\nEducation is a public good and every \nstudent has the right to free, quality \neducation provided by the state. Schools, \ncolleges and universities should be \npredominantly public institutions funded \nby public resources. We recognise that \nprivate educational institutions play an \nimportant supplementary role.\nEDUCATION\n12\n\n14. To reduce dropout rates, we will ensure that pre-ma-\ntric and higher education scholarships for disadvan-\ntaged groups including SC, ST, OBC, EWS, denotified \ntribes and minorities are restored, increased and fully \nfunded.\n15. We will ensure that all central textbooks promote a \nscientific temper and are aligned with India’s \nconstitutional values as contained in the Preamble and \nother provisions of the Constitution of India. Textbook \nrevisions will not be done arbitrarily or driven by political \nmotives.\n16. We will assist state governments to establish one \nGovernment Community College in every tehsil/taluk for \nstudents completing Class XII. These community \ncolleges will offer a broad range of degrees/diplomas \nsuitable for jobs in the service industry (e.g. hospitality, \ntourism, digital marketing, paramedical, paralegal, etc.) \nand for jobs in the manufacturing industry that require \nbasic technical skills.\n17. Congress will revive the Education Loan programme \nto college students implemented under the UPA govern-\nment and instruct banks to extend collateral-free \neducation loans up to \u00067.5 lakhs especially to students \nbelonging to the SC, ST, OBC, EWS and minorities.\n18. Due to widespread unemployment, as a one-time \nmeasure of relief, the amount due including unpaid \ninterest as on 15 March 2024 in respect of all student \neducational loans will be written off and the banks will \nbe compensated by the government.\n19. Congress will ensure that serving teachers are \nrepresented in the governing bodies of colleges and \nuniversities.\n20. We will fill all teaching and non-teaching vacancies \nin central universities and other central educational \ninstitutions.\n21. National accreditation bodies will be strengthened \nand higher educational institutions will be accredited \nbased on stringent quality norms.\n22. Online courses and digital learning have gained \nimportance. We will ensure that all students of classes \nIX to XII have mobile phones to ensure equitable \naccess to learning. We will provide free and unlimited \nInternet on college and school campuses to increase \naccessibility and connectivity.\n23. We will ensure that all coaching centres and \nEdTech companies meet stringent quality standards.\n24. We will ensure that all higher educational institu-\ntions — central, state and private — meet the \nprescribed standards for admitting students. We will \nrevisit the policy of centrally-conducted qualifying \nexaminations such as NEET, CUET, etc. and make it \noptional for state governments to adopt these exam-\ninations for admissions or conduct their own examina-\ntions meeting the prescribed standards to state-funded \nand state-approved higher educational institutions.\n25. We will assist state governments to establish \nstate-of-the-art Internet-enabled public libraries in \nstate, district and taluk headquarters.\n13\n\n1. Congress will take suitable measures to ensure that \nthe constitution of each sports body is in accordance \nwith certain norms and principles, that elections are \nheld according to the constitution of that body and the \nrecommendations of the Justice Lodha Committee, and \nthat there is adequate representation in each sports \nbody for active players, former players and women.\n2. Congress will enact a separate legislation for the \nregistration of sports federations/bodies/associations \nwhich will ensure full compliance with the Olympic \nCharter, allow for autonomy and full accountability, and \nprovide recourse for members and sportspersons \nagainst discrimination, bias, sexual harassment, abuse, \nwrongful termination, etc.\n3. Congress will provide sports scholarships of \u000610,000 \nper month to talented and budding sports persons \nbelow the age of 21.\n4. Congress will ensure that there is at least one \ncommunity sports centre in every block and municipal \ntown and at least one multi-sport coaching centre in \nevery district.\n5. We will establish a National Sports Science Institute \nto promote research and development in sports scienc-\nes and training.\n6. In order to encourage talented youth to pursue \nsports as a profession without fear of their future, \nCongress will introduce a “Sporting Heroes Job Guar-\nantee” programme to assure every sportsperson who \nhas represented India at the international level or the \nnational level a good quality job after the end of the \nsportsperson’s sporting career.\n7. We will allocate sufficient funds to promote sports \namong girls and women, persons with disabilities, and \ndisadvantaged groups such as ST.\nNo government in India’s independent history \nhas politicised sports as much as the present \nBJP/NDA government. From scheduling World \nCup games in select venues for overt political \npurposes to turning a blind eye to harassment \nof India’s Olympians by politically-aligned \npersons in sports bodies, Indian sports is \narguably going through its worst phase. \nCongress believes that Indian sport will soar \nonly when the autonomy of sports bodies is \nrestored, political bias is removed, and the \ngovernment is a strong and neutral supporting \nforce for sports development.\nSPORTS\n14\n\n1. Congress resolves to launch a Mahalakshmi scheme \nto provide \u00061 lakh per year to every poor Indian family \nas an unconditional cash transfer. The poor will be \nidentified among the families in the bottom of the \nincome pyramid. \n2. The amount will be directly transferred to the bank \naccount of the oldest woman of the household.\nAbsent a woman, it will be transferred to the account of \nthe oldest member of the family.\n3. The scheme will be rolled out in stages and reviewed \nevery year to assess the number of \nbeneficiary families and its impact on alleviating \npoverty.\nWOMEN\nMahalakshmi\nInequality of income and opportunity remains India’s ugliest truth. It is the moral and political responsibility of any \ngovernment to ensure that every Indian family is assured of a basic income every month.\nWOMEN ‘S\nEMPOWERMENT\nHistorically, women have been\ndiscriminated against and put at great \ndisadvantage. \nCongress pledges to remove the discrimi-\nnation against women and uphold and \nadvance the rights of women.\n15\n\n1. The Constitution (106th) Amendment Act marks the \nBJP’s great betrayal of women. The Amendment Act \ncontains sinister provisions that will allow the reserva-\ntion of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies to \ncome into operation only beyond 2029. Congress will \ndelete the sinister provisions and bring the Amendment \nAct into force immediately. The one-third reservation for \nwomen will be applied to State Assemblies that will be \nelected in the next round of Assembly elections in 2025. \nThe one-third reservation for women will also be applied \nto the Lok Sabha that will be elected in 2029.\n2. We will reserve one-half (50 per cent) of central \ngovernment jobs for women starting in 2025. \n3. We will ensure that more women are appointed to \nhigh positions such as judges, secretaries to govern-\nment, high ranking police officers, law officers and \ndirectors on the boards of listed companies.\n4. All laws will be scrutinised for gender discrimination \nand gender bias. The offending provisions will be \nremoved or amended in the first year of the Congress \ngovernment.\n5. We will ensure that the principle of ‘Same Work, Same \nWages’ is enforced in order to prevent discrimination in \nwages for women.\n6. The contribution of the Central government to the pay \nof frontline health workers (such as ASHA, Anganwadi, \nMid-Day Meal cooks, etc.) will be doubled.\n7. We will substantially increase the amount of institu-\ntional credit that is extended to women. In particular, we \nwill vastly enhance the credit extended to Self Help \nGroups by banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies \nand Micro Finance Institutions.\n8. The Labour Force Participation Rate of women is\nan abysmal 25 per cent. We will embark on a massive \nexercise to expand women’s participation in the work-\nforce through measures such as fair and equal wages; \nsafe places of work; childcare services; preventing \nsexual harassment and violence; and extending materni-\nty benefits.\n9. We will re-incorporate the Bhartiya Mahila Bank \n(Women’s Bank) that had made a promising start under \nan all-Women Board of Directors but was wound up by \nthe patriarchal BJP/NDA government.\n10. In matters of marriage, succession, inheritance, \nadoption, guardianship, etc., women and men should \nhave equal rights. We will review all the laws and ensure \nequality between men and women.\n11. We will ensure that laws intended to prevent \noffences against women such as the Sexual Harass-\nment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition \nand Redressal) Act, 2013 and the Protection of Women \nfrom Domestic Violence Act, 2005 are strictly enforced.\n12. The government will fund state governments to \nbuild sufficient night shelters for migrant women \nworkers and adequate number of safe and hygienic \npublic toilets for women will be provided in towns and \ncities. Free napkin vending machines will be installed in \npublic spaces, schools and colleges.\n13. In partnership with the State governments, the \nCentral Government will double the number of working \nwomen hostels in the country, with at least one Savit-\nribai Phule Hostel in each district.\n14. We will appoint an Adhikar Maitri in every Pancha-\nyats to serve as a paralegal to educate women and \nassist them in the enforcement of their legal rights.\n16\n\n1. Congress will give a legal guarantee to the Minimum \nSupport Prices (MSP) announced by the government \nevery year, as recommended by the Swaminathan \nCommission.\n2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices \n(CACP) will be made a statutory body.\n3. MSP payable to the farmer-seller at the procurement \ncentres and APMCs will be directly credited digitally to \nthe bank account of the farmer.\n4. We will appoint a Permanent Commission on \nAgricultural Finance that will report periodically on the \nextent of agricultural credit and the need for loan \nforbearance.\n5. Crop insurance will be made farm and farmer \nspecific. Premium will be charged from the farmer \naccording to the sum insured and all claims will be \nsettled within 30 days.\nFARMERS\nThe farmers’ agitations ring the alarm bells to the deep crisis in the agriculture sector.\nThe BJP/NDA government’s response has been callous and brutal. Farmers do not get fair and remunerative prices \nfor their produce; nor do the producers have adequate avenues to market their produce. Export controls have debili-\ntated farmers. The plight of farm labourers is worse; the work available is irregular and the wages have stagnated for \nnearly four years.\nAgriculture\nCongress is the only party that has lent its ear to the distress call of the farmers and farm labour and we are \ndetermined to do everything possible to alleviate their pain and make agriculture a desirable livelihood.\n17\n\n6. In consultation with farmers’ organizations, we will \nmake available to farmers three avenues for sale of \nagricultural produce:\n (a). Regulated Market under the prevailing APMC Act.\n (b). E-market that will be operated by an autonomous \nbody with representation of farmers’ organizations, \nFarmer-Producer Organizations (FPOs) and individual \nprogressive farmers.\n (c). Freedom to the farmer to sell agricultural produce \nat the farm-gate or at any other place of choice with an \noption to upload the sale-and-purchase agreement on a \ndigital ledger.\n7. We will establish farmers’ retail markets in large \nvillages and small towns to enable the farmers to bring \ntheir produce and sell the same to consumers.\n8. Congress will formulate and implement a sound \nimport-export policy for agricultural commodities, which \nwill give paramount importance to protecting the \ninterests and concerns of farmers. \n9. We will revive the system of Agricultural Extension \nServices to disseminate the best knowledge and best \npractices to every agricultural holding. We will increase \nthe number of Krishi Vigyan Kendras and appoint more \nscientists to each Kendra.\n10. We will launch a major programme to install solar \npanels connected to tube wells to generate energy.\n11. Congress will implement a major initiative to \npromote horticulture, pisciculture and sericulture, and \nencourage farmers to diversify into these activities and \nincrease their income.\n12. We will double the value of the output in dairying \nand poultry in five years.\n13. In co-ordination with state governments, we will \nensure that one agricultural college and one veterinary \ncollege is established in every district of the country.\n14. We will double the funding for R&D in agriculture in \nfive years.\n18\n\n1. We will restore the subsidy for diesel for sea-going \nfishing communities.\n2. We commit to expeditious search for fisherfolk \nmissing at sea. If presumed dead, death certificates will \nbe issued within 3 months.\n3. We will direct insurance companies to provide \ninsurance cover for sea-going fishing boats.\n4. Fishing communities will be issued credit cards (like \nKisan Credit Cards) by banks and extended credit.\n5. Fishing communities will be enumerated in the caste \ncensus and given identity cards by the Central Govern-\nment.\n6. Inland fishing and aquaculture will be recognized as \n‘agriculture’.\n7. Congress will promote phytosanitary standards and \nthe exports of marine products that meet such \nstandards.\nFISHERIES AND\nFISHING\nCOMMUNITIES\n8. Fishing harbours will be developed along the coast \nline for the use of the fishing community.\n9. We will create cooperative banks for fishing \ncommunities. \n10. Congress will establish mechanisms with neigh-\nbouring countries to resolve the problems faced by \nfishing communities, to eliminate conflict, arrests, \nseizure of boats and loss of lives, and to improve \nlivelihood opportunities for our fishing communities.\n19\n\n1. We will introduce reforms in industrial and labour \nlaws to restore the balance between labour and capital \nto meet our twin goals of full employment and high \nproductivity gains.\n2. We will address the issues of gender discrimination \nand gender inequality in workplaces and in accessing \neconomic opportunities.\n3. We will ensure that the principle of ‘Same Work, Same \nWages’ is enforced in order to prevent discrimination in \nwages for women.\n4. We will increase the wage under MGNREGA to \u0006400 \nper day. MGNREGA funds and workers may also be \ndeployed to build public assets such as classrooms, \nlibraries and primary health centres.\n5. We will launch an urban employment programme \nguaranteeing work for the urban poor in reconstruction \nand renewal of urban infrastructure.\n6. We will make a law to specify and protect the rights \nof gig workers and unorganised workers and enhance \ntheir social security.\n7. We will propose laws to regulate the employment of \ndomestic help and migrant workers, and ensure their \nbasic legal rights.\n8. The list of ration card holders will be updated in all \nStates immediately and it will be ensured that all ration \ncard holders, including migrant workers, get their \nrations regularly.\n9. We will expand the PDS coverage based on updated \npopulation figures (pending the Census). PDS will \ninclude pulses (dal) and cooking oil.\n10. Sufficient funds will be allocated to PDS, ICDS and \nthe Mid-day Meal Scheme to fulfil the mandate of the \nNational Food Security Act, 2013.\n11. We will collaborate with the state governments to \nopen Indira Canteens that will offer subsidised meals \nas has been done in Karnataka and Rajasthan.\n12. Appoint a second ASHA worker in all villages with a \npopulation exceeding 2,500 persons.\n13. Double the number of Anganwadi workers and \ncreate an additional 14 lakh jobs.\n14. The Congress guarantees a national minimum \n[EKI\u0004EX\u0004Ɵ\u0018\u0014\u0014\u0004TIV\u0004HE]\u0012\n20\nWORKERS\n\nDEFENDING THE\nCONSTITUTION\n1.We promise you freedom from fear.\n2. We promise to restore freedom of speech and \nexpression including full freedom of the media.\n3. We promise to de-criminalise the offence of defama-\ntion and provide, by law, a speedy remedy by way of civil \ndamages.\n4. We promise to end the arbitrary and indiscriminate \nsuspension of the Internet.\n5. We will review the Telecommunications Act, 2023 and \nremove the provisions that restrict freedom of speech \nand expression and that violate the right to privacy.\n6. We promise to review all laws that interfere with the \nright to privacy and make suitable amendments to \nvarious laws to uphold the right to privacy.\n7. We promise to uphold the people’s right to assemble \npeacefully and to form associations.\n8. We promise not to interfere with personal choices of \nfood and dress, to love and marry, and to travel and \nreside in any part of India. All laws and rules that \ninterfere unreasonably with personal freedoms will be \nrepealed.\n9. We promise that the two Houses of Parliament will \neach meet for 100 days in a year and the great \ntraditions of Parliament that prevailed in the past will \nbe revived and scrupulously observed. We promise that \none day in a week will be devoted to discuss the \nagenda suggested by the opposition benches in each \nHouse. We promise that the presiding officers of the \ntwo Houses will be required to sever their connection \nwith any political party, remain neutral, and observe the \nage-old norm that the ‘Speaker does not speak’.\nSaving Democracy, Removing Fear, Restoring Freedom\nIndia’s democracy has been reduced to an empty shell. Every institution, including Parliament, is perceived to have \nlost its independence and become subservient to the executive government. It is common knowledge that it is the \nwill of one person that prevails in the country. People’s trust in democratic institutions will be restored.\n21\n\nSAMVIDHANIK NYAY\n10. We reject the ‘one nation one election’ idea and we \npromise that elections to the Lok Sabha and the State \nAssemblies will be held as and when they are due in \naccordance with the Constitution and the traditions of a \nparliamentary democracy.\n11. We promise to restore the voters’ trust in the \nelection process. We will amend the election laws to \ncombine the efficiency of the electronic voting machine \n(EVM) and the transparency of the ballot paper. Voting \nwill be through the EVM but the voter will be able to hold \nand deposit the machine-generated voting slip into the \nvoter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) unit. The \nelectronic vote tally will be matched against the VVPAT \nslip tally.\n12. We promise to strengthen the autonomy of the \nElection Commission of India, the Central Information \nCommission, the Human Rights Commission, the office \nof the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Commis-\nsions for SC, ST, minorities and OBC, and other constitu-\ntional bodies.\n13. We promise to amend the Tenth Schedule of the \nConstitution and make defection (leaving the original \nparty on which the MLA or MP was elected) an automat-\nic disqualification of the membership in the Assembly \nor Parliament.\n14. We promise to restore the Planning Commission \nand define its role and responsibilities that will include \nformulating medium and long-term perspective plans \nto meet the needs of the Nav Sankalp Economic Policy \ndescribed in Chapter VII.\n15. We promise to ensure that the police, investigation \nand intelligence agencies will function strictly in \naccordance with law. They will be brought under the \noversight of Parliament or the state legislatures, as the \ncase may be.\n16. We promise to put an end to the weaponisation of \nlaws, arbitrary searches, seizures and attachments, \narbitrary and indiscriminate arrests, third-degree \nmethods, prolonged custody, custodial deaths, and \nbulldozer justice.\n17. We promise to enact a law on bail that will incorpo-\nrate the principle that ‘bail is the rule, jail is the excep-\ntion’ in all criminal laws.\n18. We will introduce comprehensive prison reform to \ntransform jails into institutions of rehabilitation, reform \nand correction.\nIn the last 10 years tremendous damage was done \nby the BJP/NDA by misusing the brute majority \nenjoyed by it in Parliament to make laws that \nviolated the letter and spirit of the Constitution of \nIndia as well as the fundamental principles of \nlaw-making, namely, necessity, consultation, \nreasonableness and proportionality.\nREVERSING\nTHE DAMAGE\nWe promise that all anti-people laws passed by the \nBJP/NDA without proper parliamentary scrutiny \nand debate, especially those relating to workers, \nfarmers, criminal justice, environment & forests \nand digital data protection, will be thoroughly \nreviewed and changed.\nWe will carry out complete investigations of the \nElectoral Bonds Scam, the reckless sale of public \nassets, the PM CARES scam, repeated intelligence \nfailures at the highest levels and corruption in \nmajor defence deals.\n22\n\nMEDIA\nIn the last ten years, significant sections \nof the media have been robbed of, or \nsurrendered, their freedom. Congress will \nhelp the media re-discover the freedom \nthat they enjoy under the Constitution.\n1. Congress has always believed that self-regulation is \nthe best way to correct the misuse of the media. \nCongress will amend the Press Council of India Act, \n1978 to strengthen the system of self-regulation, protect \njournalistic freedoms, uphold editorial independence \nand guard against government interference.\n2. Congress will amend the Press Council of India Act, \n1978 to empower the Council to deal with the menace \nof fake news and paid news.\n3. Congress will defend independent journalism by \nenacting laws to protect journalists from coercive action \nby the State. This includes restricting the powers of the \ngovernment for surveillance of journalists, seizure of \ntheir devices and exposure of their sources.\n4. Congress will pass a law to curb monopolies in the \nmedia, cross-ownership of different segments of the \nmedia, and control of the media by business organisa-\ntions. Congress will refer cases of suspected monopo-\nlies to the Competition Commission of India.\n5. All media houses, irrespective of the size, will be \nrequired to disclose their ownership structures (direct \nand indirect), cross holdings, revenue streams, etc. \nthrough their websites.\n6. Congress will pass a law to preserve the freedom of \nthe Internet and to prevent arbitrary and frequent \nshutdowns of the Internet.\n7. Many new laws (e.g. the Broadcasting Services \n(Regulation) Bill, 2023; Digital Personal Data Protection \nAct, 2023; Press and Registration of Periodicals Act, \n2023, etc.) give unbridled powers of censorship to the \ngovernment. The first named Bill will be withdrawn. The \nrestrictive provisions of the two Acts will be amended \nor deleted to eliminate backdoor censorship.\n8. Congress will amend the Cinematograph Act, 1952 \nto provide that the Central Board of Film Certification \ngrants graded certificates to according to transparent \nand reasonable criteria.\n23\n\nJUDICIARY\nThanks to the misgovernance, weaponisation of \nthe laws, misuse of investigating agencies and \nabuse of executive powers by the BJP/NDA \ngovernment in the last 10 years, the people have \ncome to look upon the judiciary as the last \nbastion against anti-democratic actions and \nauthoritarianism. An independent judiciary alone \ncan uphold the Constitution of India.\n1. The independence and quality of the judiciary is \nreflected in the independence and quality of the judges. \nCongress will unswervingly uphold the independence of \nthe judiciary. In consultation with the Supreme Court \nand the Chief Justices of the High Courts, Congress will \nestablish a National Judicial Commission (NJC). The \ncomposition of the NJC will be decided in consultation \nwith the Supreme Court. The NJC will be responsible for \nthe selection and appointment of judges of the High \nCourts and the Supreme Court.\n2. All vacancies in the High Courts and Supreme Court \nwill be filled within three years.\n3. Congress will amend the Constitution to create two \ndivisions in the Supreme Court: a Constitutional Court \nand a Court of Appeal. The Constitutional Court consist-\ning of the seven seniormost judges will hear and decide \ncases involving the interpretation of the Constitution \nand other cases of legal significance or national impor-\ntance. The Court of Appeal will be the final court of \nappeal that will, sitting in Benches of three judges each, \nhear appeals from the High Court and National Tribu-\nnals.\n4. We will allocate sufficient funds for augmenting the \nphysical and technical infrastructure of the judiciary \nand for the modernisation and maintenance of the \ninfrastructure.\n5. More women and persons belonging to the SC, ST, \nOBC and minorities will be appointed as judges of the \nHigh Courts and the Supreme Court.\n6. Congress will establish a Judicial Complaints \nCommission consisting of retired judges of the \nSupreme Court and retired Chief Justices of the High \nCourts to investigate complaints of misconduct \nagainst judges of the higher judiciary.\n24\n\nANTI-CORRUPTION\nIn the last 10 years, we have seen that several measures taken by the BJP/NDA government were actually \na cloak for corruption. Some examples are demonetisation, the Rafale deal, Pegasus spyware, and the \nElectoral Bonds scheme. Congress will probe these dubious deals and schemes and bring to law those \nwho made illegal gains through these measures.\nKnown offenders were allowed to leave the country in the last 10 years. The BJP/NDA government is \nperceived to have facilitated their leaving the country and has not been able to bring back any of the \nscamsters. The circumstances under which they were allowed to leave the country will be probed and all \nscamsters and their accomplices will be brought before the law.\nThe BJP has turned out to be a giant washing machine. Accused in registered cases who joined the BJP \nwere allowed to escape the law. The allegations against such persons will be revived and investigated.\n25\n\n1. Congress will guarantee artistic freedom. We will \noppose censorship. Attempts by vigilante groups to \ncensor or intimidate artists will be dealt with firmly and \naccording to law.\n2. Congress will commit resources and attention to \nsustaining India’s living traditions, especially to the \nflourishing of our distinct indigenous cultures.\n3. We will empower the artisan economy and promote \ncrafts-based enterprises.\n4. Congress will ensure the autonomy of national \ncultural institutions, including financial autonomy. These \ninstitutions will be administered by renowned artists \nand experts in the field.\n5. We will promote art education in schools and \ncolleges, and support institutions that exclusively teach \nthe arts.\n6. We will intensify the efforts to retrieve India’s stolen \nart and also support private efforts.\n7. Congress will support government and private \nefforts to establish museums, art galleries, libraries \nand archives. This will include smaller institutions at \nthe district level, which are the repositories of local \nknowledge about artists, artisans, folk culture and \ncommunities. We will support measures to create \ndigital archives.\n8. We will work with state governments to build a \nnational network of libraries. We will support mobile \nand community libraries.\n9. We will ensure that the National Mission on Monu-\nments and Antiquities is revitalised. The Archaeologi-\ncal Survey of India will be provided more funds and \nhuman resources.\n10. We will offer grants for the translation of traditional \nand contemporary expressions of Indian culture into \nIndian and foreign languages to foster national integra-\ntion and Indian soft power abroad.\n11. We will review and strengthen the Copyright Act, \n1957.\nART, CULTURE\nAND\nHERITAGE\nArt, culture and heritage constitute the \nidentity of a people. The BJP/NDA \ngovernment has focused on looking at \nculture through the lens of politics and \nideology, while the actual practitioners, \npractices and institutions of culture have \nbeen neglected or actively undermined. \nCongress is committed to protect the \nrich diversity of India’s art and culture \nand to ensure they thrive in an atmo-\nsphere of freedom and creativity.\n26\n\nECONOMY\nOur Economic Policy\nEconomic justice is as important as political and social justice. Sound economic policies will ensure that India, a \ndeveloping country, will attain the status of, first, a middle-income country and, then, a developed country. \nCongress’ economic policy has evolved over the years. In 1991, the Congress ushered in the era of liberalization and \nsteered the country toward an open, free and competitive economy with regulatory oversight. The country reaped \nenormous benefits in terms of wealth-creation, new businesses and entrepreneurs, a huge middle class, millions of \njobs, important innovations in education and healthcare, and exports. Millions of people were lifted out of poverty. We \nreiterate our commitment to an open economy in which economic growth will be driven by the private sector comple-\nmented by a strong and viable public sector.\nTIME FOR A RE-SET\nAfter 33 years, the time is ripe for a re-set of economic \npolicy. We need a Nav Sankalp Economic Policy. The \ncornerstone of the Nav Sankalp Economic Policy will \nbe JOBS. To create jobs, India must become a \nproducing economy. We must produce goods and \nservices for ourselves and for the world. There is a \nhuge opportunity for India to emerge as the world’s \nbiggest producer.\nWe reject jobless growth and the BJP’s legacy of \njob-loss growth. We will address the issues of inflation; \nextreme poverty among a significant section of the \npeople; hunger; nutritional deficiency among women \nand children; and the growing inequalities of income \nand wealth.\nThe three goals of our economic policy were, and will \nbe, work, wealth and welfare.\nWORK\nWork means there will be plenty of jobs and sufficient opportunities for self-employment and starting businesses.\n1. We will create thousands of jobs as outlined in the \nnext chapter. The best creator of jobs is the private \nsector. In particular, the MSME sector is the creator of \nthe largest number of jobs, especially for workers with \naverage education and average skills.\n2. We will support the private sector and every kind of \nenterprise — large, medium, small and micro — in their \nendeavour to create jobs and produce goods and \nservices.\n3. We will remove the current environment of distrust \nand fear, and create a healthy eco-system where \nprivate enterprises, regulatory authorities, tax authori-\nties and government will work in a spirit of mutual \ncooperation and respect.\n4. We will protect innovation and intellectual property \nrights, provide access to finances, and ensure the \nfreedom to produce and sell anywhere in India or \nabroad.\n27\n\n5. We will support free trade and rule-based internation-\nal trade and commerce.\n6. We will encourage and participate in bilateral and \nmultilateral trade agreements.\n7. Regulatory oversight will be based on clearly enunci-\nated laws and rules that will be applied fairly and \nwithout discrimination.\n8. We will ensure a level playing field for all.\n9. We are opposed to monopolies and oligopolies and \ncrony capitalism.\n10. We will ensure that no company or person arrogates \nto itself or himself the financial or material resources or \nthe business opportunities or the concessions that \nought to be available to every entrepreneur.\n11. Our policy preference will be in favour of business \nenterprises that create a large number of jobs.\n12. Full employment is our goal and we will make every \neffort to ensure that the large workforce is gainfully \nemployed.\n13. We will introduce reforms in industrial and labour \nlaws to restore the balance between labour and capital \nto meet our twin goals of full employment and high \nproductivity gains. The Labour Codes passed by the \nBJP/NDA government will be reviewed and amended.\n14. We will address the issues of gender discrimination \nand gender inequality in workplaces and in accessing \neconomic opportunities.\n15. We will ensure that banks offer low-interest loans \nto Self-Help Groups.\n16. Congress will undertake a comprehensive review of \nvarious charges levied by banks, stop the exploitation \nof customers, and rationalize the charges for bank \nservices.\n17. We will launch an urban employment programme \nguaranteeing work for the urban poor in reconstruction \nand renewal of urban infrastructure.\n18. We will make a law to specify and protect the rights \nof gig workers and unorganised workers and enhance \ntheir social security.\n19. We will propose laws to regulate the employment \nof domestic help and migrant workers, and ensure their \nbasic legal rights.\n20. We will reorient the tax policies towards employ-\nment and wages as well as investments and profits.\n21. We will address the growing inequality of wealth \nand income through suitable changes in policies.\n28\n\nWEALTH\nWealth and wealth creation are the goals of any business. \nIndustrial and business policies and regulations will be \ndesigned to facilitate the production of goods and services in \nlarger volumes and higher values. While production is import-\nant, productivity is equally important. Any impediment, legal \nor administrative, to larger production or higher value will be \nremoved. We will facilitate access to finances, raw materials, \ntechnology, intellectual property, and other resources both \nfrom within India and through imports. Business enterprises \nwill have the liberty to sell goods and services within India or \nthrough exports. All laws and rules that inhibit free and fair \ntrade will be reviewed and changed.\nIndia’s GDP in 1990-91 was approximately \u000625 lakh crore in \nconstant prices. In 13 years, first under a Congress govern-\nment and later under coalition governments, the GDP doubled \nand reached a value of \u000650 lakh crore in 2003-04. In 10 years \nunder the UPA, the economy doubled again and the GDP was \nat \u0006100 lakh crore in 2013-14. A \u0006100 lakh crore economy \nwas inherited by the BJP/NDA government but it wasted the \ngolden opportunity. If the UPA had continued in office, the \neconomy would have doubled again and stood at \u0006200 lakh \ncrore in 2023-24. Alas, due to the BJP’s mismanagement, the \nGDP will reach a level of only \u0006173 lakh crore by the end of \n2023-24 falling short of a target that was unachievable.\nThe Congress is committed to rapid growth and generation of \nwealth. We have set a target of doubling the GDP in the next \n10 years.\nWELFARE\nWelfare of all is the goal of all work and the creation of wealth. Owing to the skewed policies of the BJP/NDA, the \npeople of India are divided in economic terms. There is a small class of very rich, a substantial middle class, a large \nsegment of people above the poverty line but not yet the middle class, and nearly 22 crore people who are poor. \nUnder a Congress government, the welfare of the poor will be the first charge on all government resources. It will be \nthe Congress’ endeavour to ensure that the 22 crore people below the poverty line are lifted above the line in the next \n10 years; that they are able to enjoy the fruits of education, healthcare, housing, drinking water, sanitation, electricity \nand, above all, opportunities for jobs/work; and are made strong and self-reliant to compete with others who are \nhigher on the economic ladder.\nAs people move up the economic ladder, their needs are for better infrastructure and better goods and services. \nBesides, we must get the Indian economy and the Indian work force ‘future-ready’. The challenges of the future \ninclude the changes in the global economy, advanced technology such as Artificial Intelligence, robotics and machine \nlearning, and climate change. The future of our energy is Green Energy. We will mobilize the massive capital required \nfor our green energy transition.\nThe Nav Sankalp Economic Policy will aim to build a fair, just and equal-opportunity economy and bring prosperity to \nall sections of the people. Congress will herald a new beginning, just as we did in 1991, involving all sections of the \npeople in nation-building. The time has become to re-set and re-prioritize our roadmap for economic development in \nthe context of the twin challenges to our economy, namely, UNEMPLOYMENT and INFLATION.\nWe have made specific promises in different sections of this Manifesto. By implementing these promises, we hope to \nachieve the paramount goal of ushering in a fair, just and equitable economy that will make India a rich country, and \nthat will be resilient to adapt to a changing world.\n29\n\nThe most challenging issue today is widespread \nunemployment. The cry everywhere is for jobs. \nThe unemployment rate ranges from 10 per cent \n(for age 15-29) to 42.3 per cent (for graduates \nunder age 25) to 9.8 per cent (for graduates of \nage 30-34). No one has any faith in the BJP which \ndeceived the people with the false claim that it \nwill create 2 crore jobs a year. The BJP/NDA \ngovernment’s response to the grave problem was \nto abandon labour force surveys, distort data and \npretend that the problem does not exist. We \nacknowledge the problem and we promise to \ncreate millions of jobs through concrete initia-\ntives:\nUNEMPLOYMENT –\nMEETING THE CRY\nFOR JOBS\n1.Fill the nearly 30 lakh vacancies in sanctioned posts \nat various levels in the central government, teaching and \nnon-teaching posts in central educational institutions, \nposts of doctors, nurses, paramedics and other support-\ning staff in central government medical institutions, and \nvacancies in the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF).\n2. Publish a job calendar for each department, institu-\ntion and public body with details of vacancies and the \ntimelines to fill the vacancies.\n3. Abolish the Agnipath programme and direct the \nArmed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard) \nto resume normal recruitment to achieve the full sanc-\ntioned strength.\n4. Appoint a second ASHA worker in all villages with a \npopulation exceeding 2,500 persons.\n5. Double the number of Anganwadi workers and create \nan additional 14 lakh jobs.\n6. Create a new employment-linked incentive (ELI) \nScheme for corporates to win tax credits for additional \nhiring against regular, quality jobs.\n7. Launch a strategic mining programme to explore and \nmine rare earths and critical minerals with the object of \nincreasing the share of mining to 5 per cent of GDP and \ncreating 1.5 crore jobs for unskilled and skilled workers \nin the mineral-rich states.\nThe programme will be implemented consistent with \nstringent environmental and labour safety standards.\n8. We will launch an urban employment programme \nguaranteeing work for the urban poor in reconstruction \nand renewal of urban infrastructure.\n9. Provide jobs for low-education, low-skilled youth by \nlaunching a Water Bodies Restoration Programme and \na Wasteland Regeneration Programme that will be \nimplemented through village panchayats and munici-\npalities.\n10. Establish an autonomous non-profit society \ninvolving the state governments, universities and \nbusiness organisations to establish at least one Skills \nTraining Institute in each district to impart skills \nthrough short- and long-term courses to youth in the \nage group of 18-29 years. Incentivise corporates to use \nCSR funds for skill training in recognised skill training \ninstitutes.\n11. Incentivise panchayats to establish and maintain \nsolar grids that will generate power for common \npurposes and create jobs at the panchayats level.\n12. Amend the laws to make workplaces safer for \nwomen workers and with facilities for care of small \nchildren. Facilitate travel to such workplaces.\n30\n\n1. Congress will enact a Direct Taxes Code that will \nusher in an era of transparency, equity, clarity and \nimpartial tax administration of direct taxes.\n2. Congress will maintain stable personal income tax \nrates throughout its term. This will ensure that the \nsalaried class is not subjected to rising tax rates and \nhave clarity to plan their finances over the medi-\num-to-long period.\n3. We will eliminate “Angel tax” and all other exploitative \ntax schemes that inhibit investment in new micro, small \ncompanies and innovative start-ups.\n4. Congress will lessen the burden of tax on MSMEs \nowned by individuals and partnership firms.\n5. We will end the duplicitous “cess” raj of the Modi \ngovernment to deny states their rightful share of tax \nrevenues by introducing a law to limit Union cess and \nsurcharges to 5 per cent of gross tax revenues.\n6. Congress will replace the GST laws enacted by the \nBJP/NDA government with GST 2.0. The new GST \nregime will be based on the universally accepted \nprinciple that GST shall be a single, moderate rate (with \na few exceptions) that will not burden the poor.\n7. GST will not be levied on agricultural inputs.\n8. The GST Council will be re-designed. It will be the \nfinal authority on policy and on all matters relating to \nGST.\n9. The administration of GST laws will be divided \nhorizontally between the central government and the \nstate governments. Small GST-payers below a thresh-\nold will come under the purview of the state govern-\nments.\n10. A portion of GST revenues will be allocated to \npnchayats and municipalities.\n11. Shopkeepers and small retail businesses that face \nintense competition from online businesses will be \ngiven significant tax relief.\n12. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), the \nGoods and Services Tax Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT) \nand the Customs Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) will be \nautonomous judicial bodies without interference by the \ngovernment.\nTAXATION AND\nTAX REFORMS\nTaxation forms the core of governance. The \nlast ten years of the BJP/NDA government is a \ncase of “taxation gone berserk”. The share of \ntaxes paid by the common person and the poor \nthrough regressive indirect taxes has increased \nsignificantly and the share of taxes paid by \ncorporates has decreased – the exact opposite \nof what a people-friendly and progressive \ntaxation policy should be. Despite the tall \nclaims of increasing the tax base through \ndemonetistion and GST, India’s overall tax to \nGDP has not increased in the last decade, \nleaving very little room for increased expendi-\nture. Congress will undertake a complete \noverhaul of India’s taxation system to make it \npeople-friendly and efficient, and to incentivise \nprivate savings and investment.\n31\n\nINDUSTRY\nIn order to become a developed economy and create good quality jobs for hundreds of thousands of youth, it \nis critical that India transitions from a consumer economy to a producer economy. India must become a \nmanufacturing powerhouse that produces goods and services for itself and the world. To this end, beyond \neconomic and business factors, the most vital ingredient is social harmony that will attract investments and \na skilled labour force. It is thus no surprise that in the last 25 years, India’s manufacturing share of GDP has \nbeen higher during the Congress rule. On the contrary, in the last 10 years (2014-24), the share of manufac-\nturing has stagnated at 14 per cent.\n1. Congress resolves to make India a manufacturing \nhub by raising the share of manufacturing from 14 per \ncent to 20 per cent of GDP in the next five years.\n2. The most immediate objective will be to restore a \nhealthy, fearless and a trustworthy climate for business-\nes. While a Congress government in 1991 abolished \nindustrial licensing and controls, the independent \nregulatory regime that was put in place has deteriorated \ninto a system of overt and covert controls. We will \nconduct a comprehensive review of the current rules \nand regulations and repeal or amend them in order to \nrestore freedom to industry, business and trade.\n3. Congress will aim for India attaining a position of \nleadership in multiple industries such as steel, metals, \ngarments and textiles, cement, automobiles, electronic \ngoods, pharmaceuticals, engineering goods, petroleum \nproducts, chemicals, and mining rare earths and critical \nminerals.\n4. According to the RBI, nearly 60 per cent of the large \ncentral government projects have been stalled or \ndelayed and costs have risen by nearly \u00065 lakh crores. \nCongress will address the problem in a mission-mode \nand find ways and means to revive the stalled projects \nwith the help of the private sector.\n5. Congress will reform the production-linked incen-\ntives (PLI) scheme to target specific sectors that can \ncreate thousands of jobs by making India one of the \ntop 5 producers in the world in that sector.\n6. We will introduce a new employment-linked incentive \n(ELI) Scheme for corporates to win tax credits for \nadditional hiring against regular, quality jobs.\n7. We will give the highest priority to intellectual \nproperty rights and to the registration, acquisition, \nprotection and use of IPR in small, medium and large \nbusinesses.\n8. Congress will create a level playing field for all \nbusinesses. We are opposed to monopolies and \noligopolies. We will strengthen the Competition Com-\nmission of India in order to ensure that India will be an \nopen and competitive economy.\n9. Congress will simplify the corporate taxation struc-\nture and end tax terrorism. We will restrain the investi-\ngating agencies from misusing their powers to reward \nor punish corporates and ensure that they act within \nthe strict limits of the law.\n10. We will encourage and support the use of Artificial \nIntelligence, robotics, etc. which will create new and \nfrontline jobs. At the same time, we will ensure that \nthere are more job opportunities in sectors that use \nconventional technology.\n32\n\n1. Congress will mobilize public and private capital, \nincrease the pace of construction, and augment infra-\nstructure. The focus will be on design, quality, speed of \nimplementation, maintenance and accountability.\n2. Private capital must be attracted to create public \nassets and infrastructure. The BJP/NDA government \nhas inverted this model and is using public money to \ncreate assets that eventually find their way into private \nhands. Congress will stop this loot of public money.\n3. We will modernise the outdated railway infrastructure \nbut in doing so we will ensure that trains and stations \nserve the needs of the common people and commuters. \nThe railway services and facilities available to the poor \nand middle classes will be continued. \n4. KAVACH, an anti-collision device, was developed \nduring the term of the UPA. KAVACH will be installed in \nall train engines and routes to improve passenger safety \non Indian railways.\n5. Transport facilities and connectivity between rural \nareas and the nearby town/city will be augmented so \nthat people may live in rural areas and work in urban \nareas.\n6. Congress will implement a comprehensive plan for \nmulti-modal urban public transport.\n7. Road tolls are perceived by the road-users as \nexcessive and exploitative. The policy on Road Tolls \nwill be reviewed and formulae will be applied to deter-\nmine the toll amount and the period of levy for each \nstretch of the road.\n8. A regulatory regime for ports and airports will be \nestablished to promote efficiency and competition \namong ports/airports.\n9. We will promote green energy. We will implement \nrenewable energy schemes that will make the\npanchayats or municipality self-sufficient in electricity \nas far as possible. We will promote solar-powered \nengines for tapping groundwater for agriculture.\n10. We will ensure that modern scientific methods for \nexploration and extraction of natural resources are \nfollowed to protect and preserve the local environment \nand communities. Representatives from the concerned \npanchayat or municipality will be consulted before \nundertaking such projects.\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nThe hardware of an economy are roads, railways, \nports, airports and electricity. Capital expenditure \nand modern technology have to be mobilized to \ncreate infrastructure of world class quality. A \nvariety of models of building infrastructure must be \nadopted according to the needs of the economy.\n33\n\n34\n\nFEDERALISM\nCentre-State Relations\nFederalism is the foundational principle of ‘India is a \nUnion of States’. India’s fabric of federalism stitched \ntogether by mutual trust between the Union and States \nhas been systematically destroyed by the BJP/NDA \ngovernment. Congress affirms its belief that India \ncannot be administered by the central government \nalone. In most matters concerning the daily lives of the \npeople, it is the state government that is close to the \npeople and, in some matters, it is the local government \n(panchayats or municipality) that is closer to the people.\n1. We will review the distribution of legislative fields in \nthe Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and build a \nconsensus on transferring some fields from List III \n(Concurrent List) to List II (State List).\n2. India is one and many at the same time. Its unity gets \nstrengthened when its diversities are accommodated \nand celebrated. This has always been Congress’ stance \nand will remain so. Article 1 of the Constitution begins \nwith the words “India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of \nStates.” This is the guiding principle of federalism in our \ncountry. \n3. Congress will end the duplicitous “cess” raj of the \nBJP/NDA government to deny states their rightful share \nof tax revenues. We will introduce a law to limit Union \ncess and surcharges to 5 per cent of gross tax \nrevenues.\n4. We will instruct the Finance Commission to take into \naccount factors such as demographic performance and \ntax efforts in determining the shares of states in the \ndevolution of central tax revenues. We will work with \nstate governments to evolve a formula to devolve funds, \nincluding a share of GST revenues, directly to pancha-\nyats and municipalities. \n5. Taking into account rapid urbanisation, we will amend \nthe laws to grant more executive, financial and adminis-\ntrative powers to the directly-elected Mayor/Chairperson \nfor effective governance in urban local bodies. The \nadministration will be accountable to the Mayor/Chair-\nperson and the Council.\n6. Congress, as the author of the 73rd and 74th Consti-\ntution Amendments, will prevail upon the states to \nimplement those provisions in letter and spirit and \ndevolve funds, functions and functionaries upon the \npanchayat and municipality.\n35\n\n7. Congress will enhance the role and authority of Gram \nSabhas in matters concerning village panchayats. We \nwill enhance the authority of the Gram Sabha in the \nadministration of the following Acts:\n  (a.) The Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) \nAct, 1996.\n  (b.) The Forest Rights Act, 2006.\n  (c.) The Land Acquisition Act, 2013.\n8. Congress will enhance financial assistance to the \nAutonomous District Councils in the North Eastern \nstates.\n9. We will immediately restore full statehood to Jammu \nand Kashmir. We will amend the Sixth Schedule of the \nConstitution to include the tribal areas of Ladakh.\n10. We will give Special Category status to Andhra \nPradesh as promised on 20 February 2014.\n11. We will amend the Government of National Capital \nTerritory of Delhi Act, 1991 and declare that the \nLieutenant Governor shall act on the aid and advice of \nthe Council of Ministers of NCT, Delhi on all matters, \nincluding Services, except on matters concerning the \nthree reserved subjects.\n12. We will grant full statehood to Puducherry.\n1. For rural areas, Congress will pass the Right to \nHomestead Act, extend the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak \nYojana to all villages and habitations, and increase the \nfunds to and quicken the pace of implementation of the \nNational Drinking Water Mission.\n2. We will increase the wage under MGNREGA to \u0006400 \nper day. MGNREGA funds and workers may also be \ndeployed to build public assets such as classrooms, \nlibraries and primary health centres.\n3. We will launch an urban employment programme \nguaranteeing work for the urban poor in reconstruction \nand renewal of urban infrastructure.\n4. To regulate the mindless expansion of existing \ncities, Congress will support the construction of a twin \ncity near an existing city but separated by a clear green \nand no-construction zone between the old and new \ncities.\n5. To improve urban governance, the Mayor/Chairper-\nson will be directly elected for a fixed term of 5 years \nalong with a Council. Executive, financial and adminis-\ntrative powers will be conferred upon the Mayor/Chair-\nperson. The administration will be accountable to the \nMayor/Chairperson and the Council.\n6. Transport facilities and connectivity between rural \nareas and the nearby town/city will be augmented so \nthat people may live in rural areas and work in urban \nareas.\nSome issues like livelihoods, housing, water, electricity, habitat, pollution, climate change, transport and disaster \nmanagement are common to both rural and urban areas.\nThe two realities that India faces are (1) that nearly 60 per \ncent of the people live in rural areas and (2) urbanisation is \ntaking place rapidly. Hence, we have to pay equal attention \nto rural development and urban development, and provide \nadequate infrastructure in our villages and towns/cities.\nRURAL AND URBAN\nDEVELOPMENT\n36\n\n1. We will assess the infrastructure deficit in the North \nEastern states and provide more funds for building \ninfrastructure. \n2. We will support Border Trade and make every effort \nto increase the volume and value of such trade.\n3. Congress will revive the Autonomous District Coun-\ncils (ADCs) in the North Eastern states and make them \nan effective instrument of local government. We will \nensure that more funds are channelised through the \nADCs for developmental works.\n4. We will ensure that tea garden workers receive fair \nwages and other benefits in accordance with the \napplicable laws and agreements. \n5. The situation in Manipur has gone from bad to \nworse due to the callous neglect of the BJP/NDA \ngovernment. Congress will remove the present state \ngovernment forthwith and heal the wounds between \nthe communities. We will appoint a Reconciliation \nCommission to bring about a political and administra-\ntive settlement that will be satisfactory to all the people \nof the state.\n6. We will ensure appropriate compensation and \nredress for the victims and survivors of the conflict in \nManipur.\n7. A final solution and agreement will be entered into \nwith the Naga groups on the basis of the preliminary \nagreement that had been agreed in 2013-14.\n7. Congress will implement a comprehensive plan for \nmulti-modal urban public transport.\n8. Travel/transport will be made safer for women and \nchildren, especially in towns and cities.\n9. The menace of stray dogs has acquired alarming \nproportions. Solutions will be found that will protect \nhumans (especially children) and that are consistent \nwith a humanitarian approach to animals.\n10. We will prevail upon the states to implement the \n73rd and 74th Amendment to the Constitution in letter \nand spirit and ensure that funds, functions and \nfunctionaries are devolved upon the panchayats and \nmunicipalities.\nNORTH\nEASTERN\nSTATES\nThe North Eastern states within the \nUnion of India represent the pluralism \nand diversity of India. We are proud that \nwe are a diverse country that is home to \nmany races, religions and languages.\n37\n\n1.The absence of a formal National Security Strategy \nhas led to ad hoc and personalised policymaking.\nAfter detailed deliberations, Congress will issue a \ncomprehensive National Security Strategy.\n2. The Raksha Mantri’s Operational Directive determines \nthe Armed Forces’ war planning. The UPA government \nissued the last directive in 2009. Congress will bring a \nnew Operational Directive to deal with our current \ntwo-front challenge.\n3. The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) is a sensitive and \ncrucial post for military reform, preparedness and joint \noperations. Congress will institutionalise the process of \nappointing the CDS to ensure transparency and military \nconsensus.\n4. We will reverse the decline in defence expenditure as \na proportion of total expenditure and will ensure that \nsufficient funds are allocated and spent to meet the \nrequirements of the Armed Forces.\n5. Congress will scrap the Agnipath Scheme and return \nto the normal recruitment processes followed by the \nArmy, Navy and Air Force that will guarantee economic \nand social security for our soldiers.\n6. Congress will systematically expand the opportuni-\nties for women to serve in combatant and non-combat-\nant roles in the Armed Forces.\n7. The National Security Council (NSC) and the office \nof National Security Adviser (NSA) will be brought \nunder the oversight of a select committee of Parlia-\nment.\n8. The concept of national security in the 21st century \nhas expanded beyond defence of the territory to \ninclude hybrid warfare, data security, cyber security, \nfinancial security, communication security and security \nof trade routes. Congress will evolve suitable policies \nto address each of these subjects.\nNATIONAL \nSECURITY\nDefence\nThe Chinese intrusions in Ladakh and the Galwan clash in 2020 represented the biggest setbacks to Indian national \nsecurity in decades. On 19 June 2020, PM Narendra Modi gave a clean chit to China that considerably weakened our \nnegotiating position. Despite 21 rounds of military-level talks, Chinese troops continue to occupy Indian territory and \ndeny Indian forces access to 26 out of 65 patrolling points, equivalent to an area of 2,000 square km in eastern \nLadakh. A Chinese buildup in Doklam threatens the Siliguri Corridor that connects northeast India with the rest of the \ncountry.\n38\n\n9. Congress will establish a National Economic \nSecurity Board under the NSC with the following objec-\ntives:\n   (a.) to monitor possible risks to global supply chain \ndisruptions and suggest counter actions;\n  (b.) to suggest measures to reduce over-dependence \non large import sources;\n  (c.) to recommend future courses of action toward \ninward and outward investments that will strengthen \nIndia's footprint in the world;\n  (d.) to monitor global financial flows and identify \npotential threats to India, along with actions required to \nmitigate them in advance; and\n  (e.) to work on digital/cybersecurity issues that may \nthreaten India's digital financial infrastructure. \n10. We will rapidly expand domestic capacity to \nmanufacture defence and security hardware and \nequipment.\n11. One Rank One Pension (OROP) will be implemented \nin accordance with the order of the UPA government \ndated 26 February 2014. Anomalies that have arisen in \nthe implementation of OROP by the BJP/NDA govern-\nment will be rectified. We will restore the disability \npension and make it tax-free.\nINTERNAL\nSECURITY\nIn the aftermath of the Mumbai terror attacks in \n2008, Congress revamped the internal security \nsystem and implemented a number of radical \nmeasures. Distressingly, gaps have emerged in \nthe system. Besides, the increase in hate \nspeeches, hate crimes and communal strife \nhas compounded the situation.\n1.Congress will put down with a firm hand hate speech-\nes, hate crimes and communal conflicts. According to \nNCRB data, crimes against women, SC, ST and minori-\nties have increased. We will identify the perpetrators of \nsuch crimes as well as their sponsors and punish them \nin accordance with law.\n2. Congress is firmly opposed to extra-judicial illegal \nmeasures like mob lynching, police encounter killings \nand bulldozer justice. We will stop them immediately \nand punish the perpetrators in accordance with law.\n3. The unfinished agenda of the 2008 reforms are:\n     •NATGRID and\n     •National Counter-Terrorism Centre.\nCongress will take up the two subjects, complete the \nwork, and operationalise them within one year.\n4. The State police is the first responder to threats to \ninternal security. Congress will work with State govern-\nments to build, train and equip the State police forces \nto maintain law and order and to punish offenders \nwithout fear or favour.\n5. Trafficking and selling of drugs will be put down with \na firm hand. Increasingly, ports are used to smuggle \ndrugs. The regulatory and penal provisions will be \nstrengthened, and drug smugglers and traffickers, and \ntheir accomplices, will be dealt with sternly in accor-\ndance with law.\n6. The strength of the Central Armed Police Forces \n(CAPF) will be augmented and modernized. Our goal is \nthat 33 per cent of these forces will be made up of \nwomen. The Service Rules will be revised and updated. \nThe forces will be deployed having regard to the needs \nof training, rest and recuperation.\n7. We will fill the vacancies in the CAPF and achieve \nthe full sanctioned strength.\n39\n\nFOREIGN POLICY\n1. Congress affirms and will uphold continuity in India’s \nforeign policy. Our approach was profoundly shaped by \nthe freedom movement and developed through the \nwisdom of visionary leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru.\n2. There was a consensus on foreign policy since \nIndependence. Unfortunately, in many areas, foreign \npolicy under the BJP/NDA government has witnessed \nmarked departures from this consensus, notably on the \nongoing Gaza conflict. Congress pledges to restore \nIndia’s global reputation as a voice of peace and moder-\nation in world affairs.\n3. Congress re-affirms its firm belief in the continued \nrelevance of the established policy of peaceful co-exis-\ntence, strategic autonomy in thought and action, and \nincreased bilateral engagement in its relations with the \ncountries of the world.\n4. We will work to strengthen India’s role in multilateral \ninstitutions, co-ordinate positions with other countries \nof the Global South on vital issues, and continue to work \nfor reform and empowerment of international organisa-\ntions to deal with the major challenges that transcend \nborders.\n5. Enhanced foreign trade will be an important element \nof our foreign policy and we will make every effort to \nconclude long-pending trade negotiations with other \ncountries in the interests of Indian producers and \nconsumers.\n6. Congress is implacably opposed to terrorism \nanywhere in the world. We will work with other coun-\ntries to eliminate terrorist groups, terrorist acts and \ncross-border terrorism.\n7. Congress will work to repair India’s international \nimage that has been damaged by the present govern-\nment’s intolerance of dissent and suppression of \nhuman rights.\n8. Congress recognises that national security is not \nenhanced by chest-thumping or exaggerated claims \nbut by quiet attention to our borders and resolute \ndefence preparedness. We will work to restore the \nstatus quo ante on our borders with China and to \nensure that areas where both armies patrolled in the \npast are again accessible to our soldiers. We will take \nthe necessary steps to adjust our policy towards China \nuntil this is achieved.\n40\n\n9. Congress will pay greater attention to our immediate \nneighbours. We will re-establish the primacy of our \nspecial relationships with Nepal and Bhutan and \nstrengthen them to our mutual benefit. We will enhance \neconomic and cultural relations between India and \nBangladesh that are the two most populous countries in \nSouth Asia. We will work with Sri Lanka to restore the \npolitical and commercial relations between the two \ncountries and help Sri Lanka resolve its political issues \nespecially with the Tamils. We will repair relations with \nthe Maldives and work with Myanmar to protect the \npolitical and human rights of the people of Myanmar.\n10. Engagement with Pakistan depends fundamentally \non its willingness and ability to end cross-border \nterrorism.\n11. Congress will significantly increase the size of the \nIndian Foreign Service, open more missions abroad, \nleverage our economic strengths, and acquire a \nposition of leadership through the country’s values and \nmutually beneficial economic relationships.\n12. We will revive the position of a Minister of State \nhandling overseas Indians within the External Affairs \nMinistry to provide this important constituency with a \none-stop window to address their concerns.\n41\n\nENVIRONMENT\nEnvironment, Climate Change and Disaster Management\nCongress re-affirms its profound commitment to rapid, inclusive and sustainable development, and to protect its \necosystems, local communities, flora and fauna. We recall that it was Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who first put in \nplace the laws, regulations and institutions for that purpose. The National Action Plan on Climate Change was \nprepared under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Despite the BJP’s misinformed criticism of the \nAction Plan, the BJP/NDA government subsequently acknowledged its relevance and validity. However, there have \nbeen several departures from the previous policies and important components such as environment protection, \nforest conservation, biodiversity preservation, coastal zone regulation, wetlands protection and protection of tribal \nrights have been weakened.\nAir pollution and water pollution continue to extract a heavy toll on public health. Livelihoods are being destroyed in \ntribal and ecologically sensitive areas.\nCongress will address the issues of environment and climate change with the seriousness they deserve.\n1. We will constitute an independent Environment \nProtection and Climate Change Authority to establish, \nmonitor and enforce environmental standards and to \nenforce the National and State Climate Change plans.\n2. We will launch a Green New Deal Investment \nProgramme focused on renewable energy, sustainable \ninfrastructure and the creation of green jobs.\n3. We will strengthen the National Clean Air \nProgramme in order to urgently tackle the problem of \nair pollution.\n4. Congress will work with state governments to stop \nthe discharge of effluents into the rivers and water \nbodies of India.\n42\n\n5. Congress will appoint a high-level committee to study \nthe issue of landslides in the hill districts, evolve \nmeasures to prevent landslides and ensure citizens’ \nsafety.\n6. Congress will protect the coastal zones of the \ncountry. The coastal zones will be preserved without \naffecting the livelihood of fishing communities.\n7. India experienced the biggest loss of forest cover \nafter Brazil between 2015 and 2020. We will work with \nstate governments to increase the forest cover, redefine \n‘forest’ and ‘forest cover’ in accordance with modern \nscientific standards, and involve local communities in \nafforestation.\n8. Congress will provide clean cooking fuel at affordable \nprices to all households of the country. We will ensure \nthat the use of LPG cylinders is increased from the \ncurrent paltry average number of 3.7 per year among \nUjjwala beneficiaries.\n9. In order to facilitate the funding required for Green \nTransition and to achieve the goal of net zero by 2070, \nwe will set up the Green Transition Fund of India \ntogether with state governments and the private sector. \n10. We will not limit disaster management to humans \nand will expand it to include other vulnerable lives such \nas wild animals, domestic animals, pets and livestock. \n11. We will increase the allocation to the National \nAdaptation Fund and review the guidelines for use of \nthe Fund.\n12. We will transition from the 2008 National Action \nPlan on Climate Change to a National Climate Resil-\nience Development Mission to ensure that all sectors \nof development provide protocols for action and \nmeasurable targets.\n13. Conflicts between humans and wildlife have \nincreased. We will intervene and find solutions that are \nspecific to the areas of conflict.\n1. Congress will expand the remit of the Ministry of Jal \nShakti and bring all water-related activities and depart-\nments under one authority.\n2. We will implement a nationwide plan to provide \npotable water in all cities, towns and village \npanchayats.\nWATER MANAGEMENT\nAND SANITATION\nIndia has 18 per cent of the world’s population but \nonly 4 per cent of water resources. Climate change \nand an erratic monsoon have added to the water \nstress felt by farmers, industries, consumers and \nothers.\n43\n\n3. Water harvesting will be made mandatory. Desalina-\ntion plants will be installed in all coastal areas. The use \nof recycled water will be promoted for non-drinking and \nindustrial purposes.\n4. Congress will pay special attention to access to \nwater and democratic sharing of water. We will \naddress these issues by focusing on storage in dams \nand water bodies, replenishing groundwater and \ncreating a large participatory programme of water \nmanagement involving the state governments, civil \nsociety organisations, farmers, panchayats and gram \nsabhas, and municipalities.\n5. Our rivers are polluted because of the discharge of \neffluents into the rivers. Discharge of any kind of \neffluent into rivers will be prohibited by law. Pancha-\nyats and municipalities will be required by law to devise \nand implement schemes for disposal of effluents and \nwaste.\n6. Congress will end the evil of manual scavenging. \nEvery manual scavenger will be rehabilitated, re-skilled, \nprovided a job and assured a life of dignity and safety. \nThe Prohibition of Manual Scavenging Act, 2013, will \nbe strictly implemented and any person employing \nanyone for manual scavenging shall be punished. We \nwill provide compensation of \u000630 lakh to families of \nsanitation workers deceased while at work. We will \nallocate sufficient funds to enable the procurement of \nmachines that will clean sewers and septic tanks, and \nremove human waste. Free insurance will be provided \nto all sanitation workers.\n7. In collaboration with state governments, a compre-\nhensive programme of underground drainage and safe \ndisposal of sewage will be implemented in all towns \nand municipalities in 10 years.\n44\n\nThe ten years of the BJP/NDA government have been marked by exaggeration and publicity rather than substance \nand performance. The economy has registered less-than-satisfactory growth. Widespread unemployment, high \ninflation and falling consumption have debilitated even this modest growth.\nWhile the poor and the middle classes have been hit below the belt, the atmosphere in the country has become \nhate-filled and divisive. Constitutional values have been pushed to the background and majoritarianism has taken \nover.\nInequalities have widened. Every section of the people lives in fear.\nWhat India and the Indian people need at this time is a decisive break from the path of the last ten years. The people \nyearn to walk on the road of all-round development, equality, equity, freedom and justice. Congress has the capability \nto provide the leadership to the people to walk on this new road.\nThe lessons of history are there before you. Congress delivered Independence.

We appeal to you to \nvote for the ‘Hand’ symbol and for the candidates of the Indian National Congress\nIt is time to remind ourselves of Tagore’s immortal words in Gitanjali:\n Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high\n Where knowledge is free\n Where the world has not been broken up into fragments\n By narrow domestic walls\n Where words come out from the depth of truth\n Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection\n Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way\n Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit\n Where the mind is led forward by thee\n Into ever-widening thought and action\n Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.\nAN APPEAL\n45\n\n46\n\n1\nQty : 3000\ns"
